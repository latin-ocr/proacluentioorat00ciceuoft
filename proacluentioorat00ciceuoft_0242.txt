182 PRO A. G'LUENTIO.

that they were actually guilty of the misdemeanour for which
they were impeached, namely ambitus ; and to prove his
statement he cites the fact that their accusers had themselves
been convicted of ambitus, and had therefore got the advan-
tage of that part of the statute which enacted that any who
had been so convicted could secure the restitution of his

Introd. p. xxxvii.) that while an accuse& person might be
prosecuted under one statute, offences against another statute
might be used to secure his conviction.

quos ego non idcirco, etc. This shows that ambitus, which
is specially used of giving money to obtain public office, did
not include the taking of a bribe by a juror: that offence

of which offered the praemia referred to in what follows.
There may have been some technical reason which saved
Popilius and Gutta from being impeached under either of
these laws.‘ The limitatione of that section of the Lex
Cornelia which treated of ‘ judicial circumvention ’ are
detailed in chap. liv.; and from ξ 104 (qua Zegye in eo yenere a
senatore ratio repeti solet) it would appear that there were
similar restrictions to the operation of that part of the
statute de Repetundis which seems to have dealt with
corruption on the part of jurors.

in integrum restitutos, ‘restored to their civil rights,’
the praemia le9is mentioned below. Mr. Faussett cites
Modestinus, a jurist of the 3rd century (in Diqest. 48. 14. 2),
of the Lex «Iulia de ambitu (B.o. 18), qua leqe damnatus, si
alium convicerit, in inteqrum restituitur: non tamen pecuniam
recipit. The Lex Calpurnia, of Β. c. 67, must have done away
with the arrangement, which seems to have been re·embodied
in the Lex Julia: it carried the penalty (besides a fine) of
perpetual exclusion from the senate and from public office.
This Lex was in force at the date of the speech pro Cluentio,
but the case to which Cicero refers must have occurred before
the Lex Calpurnia was introduced.

cum ln eodem genere, etc„ ‘having brought others to
account for the same misdemeanour as that of which they
had been themselves convicted.’ Reprehendere means to
‘rebuke by bringing to trial,’ to ‘pull up,' ‘ bring to book.'
Prof. Nettleship cites pro Font. §3, accusatos et reprehensos
testibus: cp. cluent. ἓ 119 and (of criticism) Brut. §236 in
reprehendendis verbis versutum et sollers. For offendere, ‘to
come to grief‚’ cp. on ἓ 63.
