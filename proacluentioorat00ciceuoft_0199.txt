ex petulanti atque improbo scurra, ‘ from being a wauton
and reprobate hanger-on.' Scurra, a ‘ man about town ' ε a
professional diner-out (Hor. Sat. 1, 5, 52).

in discordiis civitatis, i.e. the civil war between Marius
and Sulla.

columnam, the Columna Maenia in the Forum, near the
common rison. At this tribunal the Triumviri Capitales (of
whom anlius was one, ἓ 38) sat in judgment on runaway
slaves and the lowest class of criminals.

multorum conviciis, ‘ amia the revilings of a mob ’ ; abl.
of attendant circumstance.

Itaque rem cum Oppianico. This is the simplest read-
ing: S'r have tum instead of rem. For the absolute use of
transiyere‚ cp. §40‚ on the strength of which Baiter sug-
gested that we should read Itaque cum Oppianico transiyit.
The occurrence of tum three times in four lines would be against
I taque tum z above, we might perhaps read tandem suffrayiis.

tam manifestam. Most edd. have bracketed tam, as

probably due to the homoeoteleuton. Ι prefer to retain it
both here and at ἓ 30, 7.

crimen hoc Asuvianum, ‘this charge in the matter of
Asuvius! Cp. the common phrase probare crimen, ‘ to make

good a charge. ' Similarly ἓ 47, quo facilius comprehenderetur
res eius indicio. '

cum tum vero, ‘not only but also': καὶ καὶ δὴ
καί (Sest. ἓ 25). Cp. ἐξ 159 and 138 (note).

in quo, sc. indicio. As analogy would lead us to expect
indicio adliyarz· rather than in indicio adliyari, it seems best to
connect in quo with constabat (‘ by which it was made clear’ z cp.
in quo constitit Naevium ex edicto non possedisse, pro Quint.
ἓ 89), and to take adliyatum absolutely, as: ‘ implicated,' εἴθ. in
the charge. Tr. ‘ the sworn information of Avillius estab-
lished the fact that the person primarily implicated was
Oppianicus.' The variant in quo inter alliqatos is explained
to mean ‘among those implicated in the affair.' Cp. the use
of alliyati in Q. Er. ii. 3, 5, which is, however, a suspected
passage. Alleyatos ( = nocentes) is to be rejected.

XIV. ς 40. se nullo modo curari velle, ‘ that she altogether
declines to be attended by one whose attentions had lost her
all her children.' A comparison of the facts stated in ἐξ 21,
22 will show that the insinuation is not to be pressed. All
that is alleged against Oppianicus in this connection up to
the date of Dinaea's death, is the fact that Cn. Magius
regarded him with suspicion at the time when he was making
his will. In regard to Dinaea herself, Cicero may have
