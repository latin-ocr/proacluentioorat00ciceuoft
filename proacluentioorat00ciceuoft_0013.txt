INTRODUCTION.

Tm: speech in defence of Cluentius was delivered in
Rc. 66, the year in which Cicero filled the office of
praetor (ἓ 147). He was then in the prime of life (aet.
41), and at the very height of his reputation as a
pleader: it will be remembered that this was the year
in which he delivered his famous oration in support of
the Manilian Law.

The accusation was brought under the Lex Cornelia
de Sicariis et Veneficis, and the trial was held before
the Quaestio, or standing commission, established by
Sulla to deal with cases arising under that statute. The
presiding judge (iudex quaestionis) was Q. Voconius Naso
(ἐξ 147-8). The J‘ury was composed, under the Lex
Aurelia (B.c. 70), of senators, knights, and tribuni aerarii.

The defendant, Aulus Cluentius Habitus of Larinum,
was impeached by Oppianicus the younger, stepson and
son-in—law of Sassia, the mother of Cluentius. The direct
charge was that the accused had procured by poison the *-
death of Oppianicus the elder, as well as of two other
persons ; but the prosecution relied also on the prevailing
belief that, at the trial of Oppianicus the elder eight years ν
before (Rc. 74), Cluentius had employed corrupt means
to secure his step-father’s conviction. The prosecution
was conducted by T. Accius, a Roman knight of Pisau-
rum, in Umbria: Cicero alone appeared for the defence

(ς 199).
