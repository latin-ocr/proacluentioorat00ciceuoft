generally refuse to convict in any trial subsequently arising
out of such assessments. Thus, for example, a person is
condemned de pecuniis repetundis ; in the litis aestimatio new
facts are brought to light which show that he has been guilty
of maiestas as well ; the jury accordingly add to the amount
of the damages a sum which is charged under that special
head 3 and yet, in spite of all this, when the accused is
brought to trial on the charge of maiestas he is acquitted.

idem iudices, the sels-same jurors in the same quaestio.
In the litis aestimatio they incriminate certain persons as
receivers of misappropriated moneys, and yet when these
persons are formally brought before them on that charge
they refuse to convict.

Scaevola condemnatus est, etc. Scaevola was found
guilty on charges having nothing to do with any misconduct
at the trial of Oppianicus (aliis criminibus). The taking of
a bribe while serving as a juror would have been a capital
offence, involving civil status (capitis); and Scaevola’s
enemies made a point of having it entered in the litis aestim-
atio which followed his conviction for malversation or extor-
tion (de pecuniis repetundis, in Verr. i. 13, 38). Cicero argues
. however that if this assessment had had the binding force of
a judicial precedent, Scaevola would have been brought to
trial afterwards under the Lex Cornelia de Sicariis (hac
Zeqe ipsa).

capitis aestimaretur, ‘ should be capitally assessed,’ i. e.
the penalty was to involve the loss of civil status. Tr.
‘Every stone was turned to get the damages assessed on
this capital charge,' i.e. to get a capital penalty awarded.

vel isdem vel aliis inimicis, ‘ through the enmity of the
same persons, or others.’

“ The punishment inflicted by the censors in the exercise of
this branch of their duties (i. e. the reqimen morum) was called
Nota or N otatio, or Animadversio Censoria. In inflicting it
they were guided only by their conscientious convictions of
duty ; they had to take an oath that they would act neither
through partiality nor favour3 and in addition to this they
were bound in every case to state in their lists, opposite the
name of the guilty citizen, the cause of the punishment in-
