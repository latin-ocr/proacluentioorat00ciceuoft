invidiae et criminum, In his ‘ exordium ' Cicero draws
a clear line of distinction between the prejudice arising out of
the bribery scandal (invidia) and the charges directly urged
against his client (crimina). The whole oration is modelled
on this division, the first part of it dealing with the invidia
(ἐξ 9-142), and the second part, more briefly, with the crimina
