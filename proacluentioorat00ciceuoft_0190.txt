i., 580, · carere publico, Milo, ξ 18.

ante quam luceret, ‘before the day had time to dawn!
{iffipgpabljunctive shows that the connection is more than

ς 28. quisquam occurs here, in conformity ·with the
general usage, in what is really a ne ative sentence. In-
stances could, however, be cited, from gicero as well as from
Livy, where the implication of quisquam is positive, and not
negative.

Dies nondum decem intercesserant, cum, etc. Similar
inversions are common in English: the two actions are
independent, the temporal clause being put first as an
independent sentence, while what is logically the principal
clause is subjoined with cum. Cp. ἓ72, Unus et alter dies
intercesserat, cum res parum certa videbatur : ἓ 83.

laetanti iam animo. Sassia has no longer any scruples,
as at ἓ 27 above; she is ‘quite pleased’ The children are
gone, and she wi'll be happy with Oppianicus, and without
them! For optime many MSS. give optima, but on the whole
the former is to be preferred. Lambinus suggested con-
firmata for confirmato. Sassia’s mind is now ‘fully con-
firmed in her expectations'3 she is quite confident in her
prospect of married happiness. Classen thinks that what
Sassia looked forward to was the ‘amplior hereditas ’ that
would accrue on the death of the children3 but this seems
far· fetched. It was rather Oppianicus who wanted her
money. cp. qui pecuniam Sassiae concupivisset above, and
propter pecuniam in what follows.

Ita quod ceteri. For the form of the sentence, cp.
§ 190, Ita quod apud ceter‚08 and (without quod) ἓ 32, Ceteri
uon videntui. Ceteri: people 1n general, as ἓ 13. Instead of
iucundum some MSS. have iucundius, which would be, like

cupidiores, an instance of the absolute comparative: cp.
alienior, ἓ 162· , occultiora, ἓ 194.

Χ. 5 29. pro vestra humanitate. Tr. ‘ You have human
hearts, and-{I can see that you are greatly discomposed,’ etc.
Op. pro illo odio quod habuit, ἓ 151.

t naturae satis fecit, he ‘ has paid the debt of
na ure.

strictim, ‘cursorilyss ‘superficially': from strinyo, of
‘grazing the surface.’ Other substantival adverbs of the same
class are ξ 19, summatim3 ἓ 30, acervatim3 §64, separatim3
5118, pedetemptim3 §185, nominatim.
