addressecl to minds already informed of the true facts
of the case. At the same time it is right to note that
this seems to be the view which has commended itself to
an able reviewer of my Translation in the Athenaeum
(lst August, 1896), from whom I quote the following :—
“At first sight it appears almost incredible that Cicero
should have been guilty of declaring that only senators
and certain other specified classes of persons could be
held liable under the section, if, in fact, the statute
contained other words which modified or nullified the

the utmost elaboration‚ but without any reference to

not liable under the section.' Cicero never claimed to
be a great jurisconfflilt, and it is strange that he did
not fortify his opinion by an appeal to men of greater
repute for learning in the law if such an appeal were
