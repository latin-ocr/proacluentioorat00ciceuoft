the Adriatic, south of the Alarrucini, who are named next.

Hor. Od. iii. 4, 16),a town in Apulia, whose name survives in
the modern village of Forenza.

ς 198. praedia negotia res pecuarias : ‘lauded pro-
perty,' ‘ business interests,’ ‘ grazin g stock.' The MSS. have res
pecuniarias, but Samnium was famous for its pasturage. Cp.
pro Quint. ς 12, erat ei pecuaria res ampla.

summo splendore praediti, as we might say, ‘most
illustrious.' For splendor, see on ἓ 46.

ab eis universis. I prefer the form eis (iis) here on the
ground that scribes more frequently made the change from iis
to his than vice versa. See Lindsay’s Latin Teaetual Emenda-
tion, p. 22. Cp. eae-hae§ 12, eius-huius§ 118.

LXX, Quam doleo, etc. The reading adopted in the text
is due to Classen. For Quam doleo the codd. give Quando, for
which Quam non was substituted in early editions, making

praesentem, with posse for possem.

Roman knight the most distinguished of all ' z tr. ‘ second to
none in distinguished standing,' or ‘that bright particular
star of our Roman knighthood.' Cp. omnibus rebus ornati,

doceret, ‘ was instructing me in.’
capite z see on ἕ 20.
maiore verecundia, ‘ with greater reserve.'

as in hanc rem arbiter, etc.

ne long-um sit. See on Zonyum est, ξ 36 : cp. ἕ 107.

§ 199. totam hanc causam vetere instituto solus peroravi:
‘ I have pleaded this case from beginning to end single-handed,
according to ancient practice.’ It was usual in the earlier
days of forensic pleading at Rome for only one counsel to be
employed in a case: later a defendant seems to have been
able to retain as many as he pleased. Cp. Brut. ἓ 207, neque
hoe quod nunc fit ut causae sinyulae defenderentur a pluribus,
quo nihil est vitiosius .· de Or. ii. ἓ 313. For vetere instituto cp.
vetus disciplina, ἓξ 76, 107, 129: Mr. Fausset compares also
