NOTES. 205

discrepare. The impersonal construction is more usual.

XLIV. ξ 123. subscripserint, suboblique: contrast quia
verum est, ξ 124 below. Here the subjunctive is used quite
naturally, following on quia censores subscripserint in the pre-
ceding sentence.

videte ne: cp. on ἓ 97.

regiam, ‘despotia' The Romans never forgot their
experience of the excesses of absolute power.

illa acerbissima proscriptio. The, horrors of the Sullan
regime were still fresh in men's memories, cp. ἓ 24. Note
the assonance of subscriptio proscriptio.

multis remediis z aq. the provision that the ‘nota of one
censor was of no effect without the concurrence of his col-

league.

illum dictatorium gladium. This connects directly with
illa acerbissima proscriptio above. For the contrast between
stilum and 9ladium cp. cedat stilus 9ladio, pro Mur. 1530.
Of the MSS. S alone omits qladiu‘m, and is followed by most
edd.: we must then repeat stilum and cp. for the double
meaning (pen, dagger) Phil. ii. ξ 34, si meus ille stilus fuisset,
ul dicitur, non solum unum actum sed totam fabulam confe-
cissem, Hor. Sat. ii. l, 39.

§ 124. sin autem, etc. ‘ But if the censor’s note ought to
have weight because it is true.' The construction is sin autem
quod subscriptum est (id) quia verum est idcirco qrave debet esse.

auctoritates censoriae: cp. ξ 117.

¹ aliquando. I have ventured to insert aliquando in the
text in addition to the vulgate unum denique aliquod. The
use of uuum aliquod is of course common enough in Cicero:
‘a single one': cp. in Verr. ii. 1, ἓ 62; Div. ἓ 27; pro Sest.
ξ 19. So also ξ 185 below, unum aliquem nominatim. The
addition of aliquando may be defended as introducing the
clement of time in addition to quam pecuniam, unde, and
quem ad modum. Palaeographically the occurrence of aliquid
in s before profectae, and the omission of aliquod in Str, may
be held to justify the suggestion of aliquando. Cp. too ἓ 92,
si in aliquam leyem aliquando ηοη iuraverat where ΞΤ omit
aliquam. So aliquid aliquando are very frequently conjoined:
Sese. ἓ 14, Plane. §35‚ Mil. §62

. vince. So Hor. Sat. ii. 3, 225, Vincet enim stultos ratio
insanire nepotes.

amplexator. The regular form is to be preferred to
amplexato, in spite of Priscian; see crit. note. The homoeo-
teleuton in defendite probably led to the substitution. For
