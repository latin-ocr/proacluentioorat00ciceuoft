5 109 ; id ipsum, 5 131 ; and passim.

nunc cum maxime (sometimes simply cum maxime),
‘ at this very moment ' : cp. Liv. xxiX. 17, 7, quae aul ab illis

interfectum cupit. This construction denotes ‘ im-
patience of anything except entire fulfilment ’ (Gildersleeve-

moral principle: pudicitia the condition of chastity which
results.

pietas, the instinct of natural affection.

dolor, not ‘ grief ' but ‘ indignation ²—the sting or pang
caused by a wrong done: Virg. Aen. ii. 594, quis indomitas
