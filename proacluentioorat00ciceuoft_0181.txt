N OTES. 121

· capi, ‘to be ensnared': so s· 36, capere Asuvi adules-
centiam.

1110 communi dolore mullebri, ‘ the anguish which any
ἔξὲξὲιι would feeL’ Dolor again of indignant resentment, as

in eius modi iniuriis, ‘ at so foul a wrong,' like ἐπί with
the dative in Greek. Op. Virg. Aen. ii. 540,' Non talis in
hoste fuit Priamo, ‘in the case of,' ‘in dealing with ' ; and §51
below, eciam si in minus firmis causis hominum periculis non
de fuissem. See also on in eadem iniuria, ἓ 32.

pennatum. Pelea· is always used with a reference to
the injured wifes: cp. ἓ 199, filiae pelex ‘the mistress of her
daughter’s husband.'

scelere, a strong word. Her daughterly instincts, as
well as her own purity, revolted from the‘ sin ’of even pro-
testing where her mother was concerned: such a protest
might seem to involve im ieta a.s

maerore et lacrimis. This 1s classed by R0⁴by (ξ 1228)
as an ablative of cause: her sorrow made Cluentia an old

woman before her time. Cp. Sest. ξ 110, otio et tranquillitate
reipublicae consenescebat.

manibus et gremio, one of Cicero's double phrases: tr.
‘clasped in his arms.' The similar phrase sinu complexuque
is very frequent in Cicero. For the duplication cp. atrocitatis
atque invidiae, §93 re9ionis et vicinitatis, ξ 11 ; vi ac necessi-
tate, ἓ 19 ; consuetudinem audaciamque, ἕ 33 3 vita et audacia,
ἓ 50 ; mente et coyitatione, ἓ 69 ; vim atque victoriam, ἓ 25.

eiusmodi sortitio. Divortium in the text is nominative, as
always in classical Latin. In Plautus (cp. Virg. Ecl. V. 66)
ecce often takes an accusative of the object, as Ecce me! ε cp.
em in such phrases as E'm tibi hominem! The nominative
implies a statement or judgment; the accusative an exclama-
tion (cp. O scelus, ξ 15; 0 viros fortes, ξ 153). For ecce autem

c.p Plaut. Trin. 389, ecce autem in beniqnitate repperi neyotium.
Virg. Aen. ii. 203.

ut in tantis iniuriis, not‘ considering the magnitude of
her wrongs' (Pausa-zea), but to be taken closely with non
invita, ‘as was natural in a case of so foul a wrong‚': so
ut a viro non libenter: ‘ reluctantly, as was natural in leaving
a husbandss The difference will be made apparent by con-
trasting Satis ut in re trepida impavidus, Liv. xxii. 5 (i. e. so
far as was possible, considerin9 the crisis), and Senatus, ut in
trepidis rebus, dictatorem clici Mam. Aemilium iussit, id. iv.
