NOTES. 181

iudicium, of the present trial, ie. the trial of Cluentius, and
illo, of the trial of Bulbus: cp. ἓ 96 above, hanc causam ab
illa debet seiunyere.

hoc crimen, i.e. his corrupt conduct at the trial of
Oppianicus was made a charge against him. So again below,
At hoc obfuit ei maxime, ‘but still it told heavily against him.'

lege tenebatur, i.e. was included under the statute.
Op. §20‚ cum res oculis ae manibus teneretur. So often of
an accused person, leqe haerebat.

ista divinatio est, ‘this is mere guess-work’: cp. ἓ 131.
For the attraction, cp. vis illa fuit, ξ 96 : and see on ἕ 34.

vide ne, lit. ‘ see to it, lest ’ ε tr. ‘ you will perhaps find
my inference nearer the mark.' For coniectura, see on ἓ 20.

mihi, ethic dative: 5114, Quid enim mihi damnatos
ambitus colliyitis? Cp. Verr. iii. §213, Tu mihi Antonii eaeemplo
istius audaciam defendis ,9

XXXVI. § 98, P. Popffi: not the same person as the
Popilius of § 95.
qul causam de ambitu dixerunt, * qui accusati sunt ab eis
qui erant ipsi ambitus condemnati. This is the reading of
all the MSS„ but it is impossible to believe that Cicero is
{253011132132 ἷὲἒηὲἓθηῖἶῗὲῗὲῑ ῗιῖῗεὲξὲἒὲεΒῗνέῗίἓῗὲξῖὶηοῖἳῗ
ably harsh (especially with quos immediately following), but
there is also a tautology in qui causam dixerunt, qui accusati
sunt: instead of which Cicero would surely have written qui
accusati sunt de ambitu ab eis qai, etc. Mr. Lendrum (H erma-
thena, vi. p. 358) takes the second qui (before accusati sunt) as
an instance of the use of a relative to introduce a refutation :
cp. Phil. ii. ἕ 14, euius etiam familiares, etc., §27 and ξ 71.
The late Professor Nettleship proposed to read quia, explain-
ing qui causam de ambita dixerunt [non de iudicio corrupto]
quia accusati sant, eta: cp. Quint. v. 10, 108, where Quintilian
takes the restoration to civil privileges (in inteyrum restitutos)
of the prosecutors in this suit, who had themselves been eon-
victed of ambitus, as the siquam that Popilius and Gutta were
prosecuted for ambitus and not for judicial corruption. But,
on this view, quia would certainly be more in place if instead of
qui causam de ambitu dixerunt some such clause as quos causam
de ambitu dixisse constat had preceded it. I have ventures]
to place a full stop at dixserunt, and to read in what follows
Quid ‘2 Accusati sunt. Accius had argued that the judgment
against Popilius and Gutta, brought to trial on a charge of
ambitus (‘corrupt electioneering ractices,') was really due
to their conduct at'the trial of ppianicus. Cicero replies
