INTBOD UOTION. xvii

previously committed himself to a quite different version
of the facts and circumstances involved in the case.
P. Cannutius, the counsel for the prosecution at the trial
of Scamander, is represented (g 52) as having proved
more than a match for Cicero. As the guilt or innocence
of Oppianicus turns greatly on the incident in which
Scamander figures, and as that incident has generally
been misrepresented by commentators, it may be worth
while to re-state it here.¹

What Cicero now wishes his hearers to believe is that
Oppianicus, having conceived the design of removing
Cluentius by poison, employed as his agent Fabricius,
who, in turn, had recourse to the services of his freedman
Scamander. The latter approached Diogenes, the slave
of the physician who was at the time in attendance on
Cluentius. The text makes it quite clear that it was
of the essence of the plot that Diogenes was to
administer the poison: cp. ἐξ 47, 55, 61, 62. This
he brings with him to the interview described in ἓ47,
as clearly appears from certain words used subsequently,
constitutum inter eos ut medicamentum, non venenum
Dioyenes adferret, ἓ 53. Scamander, on the other hand,
brings a packet of money (pecunia obsiqnata)—sealed‚

possibly, with the seal of his master, Fabricius. This was, ,

according to Cicero, the money consideration to be handed
to Diogenes for the commission of the crime. When the
viri bom' emerged from their concealment, this packet was
certainly found on Scamander's person. Ramsay remarks
that the money without the poison would have proved
nothing3 and other commentators explain the words of
ἓ 47, pecunia obsiynata quae ob eam rem dabatur, as
meaning that Scamander was in the act of handing
Diogenes the money, and Diogenes in the act of
giving Scamander the poison. But we have seen
