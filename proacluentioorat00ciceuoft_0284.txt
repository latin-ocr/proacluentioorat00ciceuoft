amicos nostros. It is difficult to decide between nostros ⁷ Α,

and nobis: 101· the latter cp. Non possum ei non amicus 0880,
Fam. ix. 24. The adjectival construction would seem to be
the commoner of the two with inimicus, as often in this speech.

lex ipsa renuntiavit. For the significauce of this state-
ment, as bearing on Cicero's legal argument, see Introd. xxxi.

ita defendisse ut. Tr. ‘ Have I in my defence so much

teneretur. Similarly ἓξ 144, 145, 148, 150.

ut hominem confirmare oportet: ‘ so far as it becomes a
fallible being to speak positively.' Similarly Tuffc. 2, 565,
prudentes ut est captus homiuum sali-3, ‘in so 131· 33 human
capacity admits' : pro Ley. M an. ἓ 70, pericula facile, ut
hominem praestare oportet, innocentia tecti repellemus. Cp.
also ἕ 52, quod timide dicam.

purgandi istius invidiosi criminis : ‘ of refuting the odious
charge made against my client‚' the charge namely of having
used bribery to procure the conviction of Oppianicus. From
this and other phrases (see Introd. p. xxxii.) it will appear that
Cicero does not always observe the distinction between invidia
and crimina 30 carefully drawn in ch. i.

ξ 144. fortasse. This is the preferable form: fortassis

cannot be established for classical Latin. Cp. ἓ 201.

displicetne mihi. I return unhesitatingly to the
reading 01 ST, though it has been unanimously rejected by
editors in favour of displiceatne mihi,—evidently a correction
made by some scribe who thought that quaeret fortasse
quispiam must go with what follows. Displicetne mihi is a
question which the orator puts to himself, and which he
answers in mihi vero nou displicet. There is thus no call

utor instituto meo, ⁴ I am following my habitual prac-
tice.' So vetere instituto, ἓ 199.

hominis honesti prudentisque, ‘a reputable and intelli-
gent person.’ If it were not that consilio occurs below (with
voluntati), seeming to take up prudentis, I should propose to
read pudentis instead: cp. pudor, honesta vita, §83; pudent-
issimo et iu primis honesto, ἓ 165. So pudor, ἓ 133: cp. ἓ 94.

qui deberem, parenthetical: “When this case was
put in my hands—and I ought to know the laws.'' This
clause seems to hang evenly, as it were, between ad me in
what precedes, and dixi in what follows; its effect is, how-
