words in both parts of the sentence. Audiatur is subjunctive
because the clause forms part of what is passing in the
speaker's mind (‘reported thought'): reperiatur is also sub·
junctive because it is part of what the speaker wishes to convey
to the minds of his hearers. On the other hand, the indicative

his reading ipsius criminis = ‘ the charge on its merits‚’
the actual issue as contrasted with the surrounding circum-
stances.

quis iudicio publico condemnaretur3 ἓ 140, quo animi in-
