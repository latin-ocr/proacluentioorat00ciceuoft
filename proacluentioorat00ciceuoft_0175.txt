understandings (‘ thinking faculty ' ; reor), oratio=my argu-

ne repugnetis. The construction still includes the uc
which follows postulo and introduces adferatis. Cp. in
Verr. ii. ἓ 148, Ρο8εαίαηε enim non uti ne coyantur statuere:
quid iqitur? ut ipsis ‘ne liceat.

animis remittatis. A proposition is more usually
found along with such a construction as this (ex animo
dimittere): Lucr. vi. 68, quae nisi respuis ex animo, lonyeque
remittis. Tr. ‘renounce it willingly, or at least with
resignation?

tum autem. Tum resumes primum deinde, as often,
and does not introduce the cum which follows it. The absolute
use of diluam is explained by its proximity to dicam (both
future3): cp. Verr. act. pr. ἓ 33 dicendo ac diluendis criminibus
content ere.

ad extremum, ‘till the end, ’ as Caec. § 28, testis exspectatus
et ad extremum reservatus z more usually, ‘ at the last,' ἓ 50.

cum peroraro, ‘ when I have finished pleading ἐ so ἓξ 59,
145. The word is used in another sense in ἓξ 164, 199, where
it means to plead a case from beginning to end.

animo is quite in place, though most editors bracket the
word. It repeats the idea contained in taciti: cp. Lucr. v,
1090, Illud in his rebus tacitus ue forte requiras. Cicero is
asking the jurors not to place counter-arguments before their
own minds (taciti) as he went along ; but, when they came to
consider their verdict, to ‘mentally demand that any real
omission he might have made should be supplied.’ Not till
he reached the end of the case was his audience to be at
liberty to decide that he had not met every objection, or that
he had ‘burked' any essential point. Miiller adopts the

emendation a me for animo (aio). I suggest rather animo a
me: a me may easily have fallen out (as in s'r at ἓ 29, 12)
after the contracted form of animo.

ΙΙΙ. §⁸ ’1. ex contraria parte audiatur, a case which· ‘you
have heard stated by the other side ' for eight years together
(continuos). And the misrepresentation is not over yet 3 hence
the present (audiatur) of what includes the time of speaking
—as often with iam dudum, etc., ay. ἓ 63.

tacita of thought which finds no expression: cp. ἕ 63
tacita vestra exspectatio. See my note on Quintilian x. 1, ξ 18.

audiatur above, intelleyo and incelleyatis being the important
