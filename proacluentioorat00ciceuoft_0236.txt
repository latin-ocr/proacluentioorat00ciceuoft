innocentem circumvenerit, ‘ compassed the ruin of an

This may be taken as roof that Cluentius, though an eques,
was accused not only onoisoning but also under¹ that section
of the Lex Cornelia which related to conspiracy and judicial
murder, and which was technically applicable only to senators.
See Introd., p. xxxiii.

accusatum oportuit. For the constr„ see on §129,
where the protasis also is in the indicative. With esset
oportuit, cp. Mil. 531, Quod si ita putasset, certe optabilius

quaerebat, i.e. ‘ was acting as judge ' (iudex quaestionis).

expectasset, resumes oportuit, but not being an im-

subsortitionem eius, lit. ‘ the filling-up of vacancies by
Junius.’ Tr. ‘had no note of the appointments made by

subsortitio (supplementary to the original {sortitio) was con-
ducted in each case by the iudex quaestionis with the
authority of the city praetor ,(cp. on §103). I transcribe
the following note from my Translation, p. 140: “Sometimes
it was the challenging (reiectio) of prosecutor and defendant
that had brought down the jury below its proper number;
but in the trial of Oppianicus some other cause had probably
intervened not long before the end of the case. J unius was
charged with having chosen Fidiculanius out of the regular
order (§103); and he was suspected generally of having
