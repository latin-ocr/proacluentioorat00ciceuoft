172 PRO A. CLUE'NTIO.

the hearing closed ε §73‚ Cannutio placuit repente pronun-
tiari DIXERUNT. Cicero asks how it was that Cluentius
and< Cannutius, (if it was they who bribed‚) allowed Staienus
to be away whem the time for consultation arrived (cum in
consilium iretur) ε and more definitely still how it came about
that at the very moment when they had the' proceedings
closed (cum iu, consilium mittebant), they failed to insist on
the presence of the absent juror, leaving it to Oppianicus and
Quinctius to do so.

cui quod tu dicis. On the strength of the reading of s
(cui quod), I have ventured on this emendation of the text:
tu dicis may easily have got mixed up with iudicem preceding
cui. [Cp. 565, where, owing to a similar error, ST agree to
omit datam post iudicium] The singular is quite appropriate
after the interpellation At enim Staienus at the beginning of
the section: cp. Tene hoc dicere, ἓ 84: ut tu dicis, ἓ 87.
But there is something awkward about the three-sold
repetition of cum in consilium iretur, cum in consilium
mittebant, and ne in consilium iretur. It looks as if cum in
consilium mittebant and Staienum have crept in from the
margin, and perhaps what Cicero wrote was, Gur iudicem
cui quod tu dicis pecuniam dederant non requirebant ? On the
other hand, Hartman would altogether omit the w0rds qui
(cui) pecuniam dederant, and read simply cur Staienum iudicem
non requirebant?

Hanc enim. ‘ Yes‚ for,' etc.
istinc 111116. Note the elaborate chiasmus. Cp. ἓ 101.
patimini ε imperative, as at ἓ 200.

ΧΧΧΙ. 5 84. ad conciliationem gratiae, ‘ for the purpose of
making up the quarrel.' Cp. the phrase redire in qratiam
cum aliquo : and ἓ 101, reyes a 86 in qratiam esse reductos.

'rene 1106 dicere, infinitive of exclamation (ἓ 15), ‘ To
think that you.’ Cp. Verg. Aen. i. 37, mene incepto desistere ,-
Plin. ΕΡ. iv. 3, 5, Hominemne Romanum tam Graece loqui.

dicunt, of a common saying. See Hesiod‚ Works and
Days, 293 sqq.
quod opus sit, tr., ‘the appropriate idea.'

ipsi, dative of personal interest: cp. the phrase, ei ad
pedes me abieci.

alterius bene inventis, ‘ his neighbour’s happy thoughts?
tum recenti re, as ἓ 36. Cp. recentem tum, ξ 79. Here
tum is resumed by cum faucibus premeretur, ‘ when they had

him by the throat.’ Faucibus is the ablative of the part
affected: cp. captus oculis.
