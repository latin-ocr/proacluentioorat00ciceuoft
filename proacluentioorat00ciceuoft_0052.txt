ς 23, 8 adolescentis PST, adolescentie propinquos ω.
5 146, 7 contineaturl PST, teneatur ω.

Less weight iS to be attached to Such minor coincidences
as the occurrence of 6336 in PST at ἓ 23, 15 si interfectum
M. Aurium 6336 comperisset, and its omission in w.2 On
the other hand, as has been stated above, there are many
places where P sides with ω rather than with ST: 69. ἓ 77,
10 6336 iudicia Ρω, iudicia 6336 ΒΤ; ξ 32, 14 plures Ρω,
multos ST: ἓ 20, 24 debuerit Ρω, potuerit ST,-—where ST seem
not only to have “improved'’ debuerit into potuerit, but
also timere into timeret.

We may argue in the same way that, while neither
version is free from accretions‚ the ST tradition is purer
than that of the vulgate: 69, ἓ 3, 2 iu liae PST, in liae
tanta ω, where tanta iS an addition of a familiar kind (so
probably also suum, ἓ 9, 1, and g 21, 6 ε tota, ξ 133, 23):
similarly idm, ᾗ 16, 21, matre, ibid. 263 publicis, ἓ 27, 10;
secundis, ἓ 32, 33 suae, ἓ 72, 13; nummum, ἓ 87, 6;
tribuni plebis, ἓ 137, 28; iudices, ἓ 201, 7. Again, in
ξ 16, 1 verum etiam in ST is glossed to sed etiam in ω, aS
frequently: see Clark on pro Milone, ἓ 61.

The following are places where the readings of ST are,
in all probability, to be preferred: g 12, 23 6α6 nuptiae
S, liae nuptiae ω :3 §39, 24 in quo alliqatum ST, in quo
inter alleyacos ω : ἓ 57, 24 uisi forte hoe causae etc., STb2,
and Cod. S. Vict., om. ω : ἓ 94, 3 putarunt4 ST, putaverunt ’

1 So ξ 47, 53 collocutus ΒΤ, probably rightly, against locutus ω.

2Op. §16, 25 6336 STb2, om. w: ἓ 75, 6 and ἓ 77, 14 6336 P, om.
m: 381, 17 and ξ 136, 6 6336 ω, om. ST. There is often a similar
uncertainty about se: see note on accepisse dicebat, ἓ 100.

³ Oopyists more frequently change eae to hae, iis to his, etc., than
viee versa (see Lindsay's Latin Textucd Emendation, p. 22). So
327, 2, §29‚ 5, 346, 20, ξ 198, 12 iis ST, liis ως ἓ 20, 22 his all
codd. for iim §22 17 eis P, liis STF, iis M; ἓ 99, 22, ἓ 131, 25 eis
edd„ his STF. On the other hand, ἓ 118, 14 huius ω, eius ST.

⁴Oieero seems to have preferred, in general, syncopated forme²
