NOTES. 195

Iam videtur aliqui. After much hesitation, Ι have
decided to adopt videtur in my text. A misunderstood contrac-
tion may have given rise to the diversity of reading. ΒΤ have

suggests puto videtu-r (see notge in Transl.) is probably right in
holding that an indicative is required by the parallelism of the
clauses with iam: otherwise one might advocate putetur, on
the basis of the reading of S'r, pointing out the confusion be-
tween similar forms in ξ 96 and ἓ 25 where the codd. wrongly
agree on arbitraretur for arbitretur: so in ἕ 201, 9, ST have
quereretur for queretur, and again, ἓ 155, arbitretur, ST: arbitra-
retur, ΕΜ. Op. the significant variant putaretur videretur, §31,
17 ; also§ 16, adfiu„ where F has videretur for putaretur, w:
so too M il. ἓ 72, videbatur, P, and Quint. v. 11. 12, putabatur, ω.
Itis impossible to accept Mr. Faussett's defence of putaretur:
‘it follows that some one might have been thought (by the
jurors who acquitted him) to have honestly condemned Oppia-
nicus, although he did not sit from the beginning.' N ecaretur,
ἓ 45, is quite different z see ad loc. The common reading
potuit (adopted by Muller) is inadmissible: immediately above
we have potuit esse innocens, and potuit ...sedisse could not
occur here : poterit would be preferable.

quaero quis sit nocens? ‘I ask, who is guilty.’ This
form of question is resumed in the more direct quis aceepit,
which follows. Mr. Faussett defends qui sit (ST) on the ground
that qui “ gives a sense sufficiently distinguishable from that
of quis: I ask, not what, but what sort of juror is guilty:
where are we to look for a guilty juror. '' Cp. Acad. ii. §9,
‚statuere qui sit sapiens vel maxime videtur esse sapientis. The
distinction is a very difficult one. See Beisiq-Haase (Schmalz
and Landgraf) n. 356, pp. 61-3.

in quemquam. Madvig’s emendation cuiquam, accepted by
recent editors, does not seem to be indispensable: any more
than his aut quidquam (aliud quidquam, Davies) suis-se for
aliquid fuisse (‘or that there was something') in what follows.
As Dr. Reid says, “ Cicero is thinking of a definite statement
that there was something] different ³³: this he denies. See
collection of exx. of aliquis in negative sentences, Reisiq-

Haage, n. 352, pp. 53-4.

5 114. niti videbatur, ‘was seen to rely.' This is the
reading of most codd.; it seems more probable than the
nitebatur of ST, which is more likely to have arisen out of it
than vice versa: cp. Acad. ii. ἕ 70, where all MSS. have
facerent for facere dicerent. Similarly servi sumus— servimus
ξ 146. Ιῐι ἓ 51 ST wrongly give laudari for laudi dari. ’
