he had never been brought to trial till Cluentius raised his
action against him. The anarchy which attended Sulla's
triumph (ξ 25) may have afforded him a protection against
the exposure of some of his misdeeds ; but the murder of
his first wife Cluentia (ξ 30), as also that of his brother,
O. Oppianicum, and of his brother's wife (ξ 31), was ’
anterior to that date, and ought to have been enough
in themselves to bring him to justice. There was also
the charge of having made away with two of his own
children in order to clear the way for his marriage
with Sassia (ἓ 27); and lastly, there was the alleged
assassination of Asuvius (ἓ 36), which threatened indeed
to come to light, but was in some mysterious fashion
covered up and put out of sight.

Cicero has certainly not scrupled to paint the picture
in the darkest possible colours. But making every
allowance‘ for rhetorical exaggeration and for the
desire to whitewash, as it were, the defendant at the
expense of the prosecutor's father (ἓ 10), there can be
no doubt that Oppianicus was a man of the worst
character. And when we remember that he was
represented at the present trial by his widow, Sassia,
“uxor generi, noverca filii, filiae pelex ” (ἓ 199), we may
well echo Mommsen's judgment ε “the criminal statistics
of all times and countries will hardly furnish a parallel
to the dreadful picture of crimes—so varied, so horrible,
and so unnatural—which this trial unfolds to us.'‘'

The averment of the prosecution was that it was
Cluentius who had procured the death of Oppianicus
(as well as of two other persons) by poison.

It was certain that there had been enniity between the
two. The quarrel as to the status of the Martiales (ἓ 43),
and his stepfather's interest in the succession to the
estate of Cluentius (ἓ 44), are put forward by Cicero as the
