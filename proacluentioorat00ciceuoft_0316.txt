of the sentence is in favour of the traditional dicite quis

‘ What is one to do with him?' i.e. what use can one put him
to? The usage is common in Plautus and Terence, as well as
in Cicero: Plaut. Cas. 5, 4, 6, quid fecisti scipione? On the
other hand there is the use of facere, with a dative: see on
g 134, and cp. anc. ξ 30, Quid huic tu homini facias?: ad
Aa. vii. 3, 2, Quid enim tibi faciam? Hor. Sat. i. 1. 63, quid
facias illi: Plaut. Amphit. 459, Vivo fit quod numquam quis-
quam mortuo faciet mihi. This is a form of the Dat-ivus
Commodi (or Incommodi, ξ 53), where the person is regarded
as the object rather than as the instrument of action. Some-
what analogous is the difference between e.9. assuetus labore,
and assuetus militiae.
