origin of the ‘feud between him and his mother Sassia,
ἕξ 11·18. The grounds on which Oppianicus was con-
demned—a catalogue of abominable crimes ; Cluentius, in

particular, was driven to prosecute him by an attempt on
his own life, ἐξ 19-42.

ἐξ 43-61. Ploc ayainst Cluentius.

Motive of the plot and occasion of the collision between
Cluentius and Oppianicus, ἕξ 43-45. The plot is detected,
ἓξ 46-48. Conviction of Scamander and Fabricius, and, by
implication, of Oppianicus, ἓξ 49-61.

ἓξ 62-87. Trial of Oppianicus.

Oppianicus, in view of these praeiudicia, had every motive
to practise bribery3 Cluentius had none, ἐξ 62-64. His
dealings with Staienus3 knavish conduct of the latter,
ἐξ 65-76. The prejudice against Cluentius due to the
political agitation of the tribune Quinctius. His innocence
proved from his account-books, whereas there is no plausible
explanation of the transaction between Oppianicus and

Staienus, ἐξ 77-87.

ἐξ 88-142. Previous Decisions alleyed to imply the
‚ Guilc of Cluentius.

The issue of the guilt or innocence of Cluentius has never
till now been directly raised, ξ 88. The various praeiudicia
quoted against him ought not to be allowed to prejudice
his case. In particular, the condemnation of C. Junius was
due to a passing outburst of popular feeling, ἕξ 89-96. The
convictions of Bulbus, Popilius, Gutta, Staienus, Fidiculanius
Falcula, and Septimius Scaevola were due to extraneous
causeS‚ not to any charge of corruption at the trial of
Oppianicus, though the prevailing belief that his conviction
had been procured by bribery was used in each case as a
weapon against the defendants, ἕξ 97-116.

The censors’ stigma cannot rank as a judicial decision‚
ἐξ 117-134. Nor can anything be founded on the will of
Egnatius, ἓ 135, or on the resolution of the senate, which
was most guarded in its terms, ἐξ 136-137.

N o more can Cicero's own previous utterances and opinions
be quoted against him: retractation of what had previously
been said in ignorance of the facts, §g 138-142.
