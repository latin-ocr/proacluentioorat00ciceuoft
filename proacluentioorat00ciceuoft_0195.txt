NOTE'S. 135

executor, and was bound to pay it. Hence a testator was
said to bequeath a legacy (leqare) ΑΒ HEREDE.’'—Ramsay.

sl qul natus esset. This is the reading of most MSS„
and it seems natural : S. and ¹1⁸„ however, give eric, and again
in ἓ 34——a vivid presentation of what may have been the
actual wording of the will.

ab secundo herede. See on ξ 32. Cp. the phrase solvere
ab aliquo : ad Act. vii. 18, 4, Quintus frater laborat uc tibi
quod debet ab Eqnatio solvat, where Tyrrell and Purser render,
‘ Quintus is anxious to give you an order on Egnatius for the

money he owes you.’ For ab with the ablative of the ‘ source
from which,' see Roby, 1810.

ᾖ 34. Quid. suspicatus sit refers to the precautions de-
scribed above as having been taken to prevent foul play:
gvzffglt ifzgcliliggvzit (‘his estimate of the man ’) must be read with

cuius=cum eius, a reading which is, in fact, found in
many MSS. Cuius corresponds better with eum in the
apodosis. Tr. ‘ Though he was making the son his heir,' etc.

liberis, ‘ his offspring,' as in ἓ 31.
inum Magium, ‘poor Magius.'

non longe animo prospexisse. This passage has been
much debated. Baiter, Ramsay and Muller follow most MSS. in
omitting the own, which is, however, found in ST (and so Clas-
sen, Kayser, Faussett). Without non the obvious explanation
is, ‘Magius saw far into the future on his death-bed? His sus-
picions were, in fact, well founded 1 cp. quid suspicatus sit
above. Inserting non, commentators take Cicero to mean
‘ the range of Magius’s mental vision did not, after all,
reach far into the future) He had foreseen what was likely
to happen, but had not guarded a ainst it sufficiently τ “ his
utmost foresight was short-sighte in the face of such enter-
prising villainy. '’—Faussett.

A closer consideration of the text has suggested to me
that non ought to be retained, though with a different ex-
planation. The key to the meaning seems to lie in praesentem
below. Magius had foreseen, with all the prescience of a
dying man (morientem), what was to happen after his decease,
and it was no distant vista! (non Zonye.) Oppianicus took
action· at once on the lines Magius had feared: praesentem
pecuniam mulieri solvit.

For the phrase cp. de Amic. ξ 40, Etenim eo loco,
Fanni et Scaevola, locati sumus ut nos Zonye prospicere oporteat
futuros casus rei publicae: and de Rep. ii. ξ 12, consilium
hominis iam tum lonye providentis secutus est.
