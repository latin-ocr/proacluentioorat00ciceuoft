xlvi PRO A. CLUE'NTIO.

century from a recension then current, containing various
readings which had approved themselves as a genuine
tradition. And again, a composite codex like s may have
been drawn from different sources, so that while its
version of, αφ, the pro Milone may be found to be
inferior (especially when compared with' existing Mss. of
better family), for the pro Cluentio it may have had
a more trustworthy original to rely upon.

In the settlement of this question the most important
factor would seem ὰ priori to be the evidence of Ρ, which,
though merely a fragment, is unquestionably the oldest
of all existing sources, But P makes bad mistakes of its
own: one has only to look at the opening part of the
speech in Baiter’s collation to see what it is capable of.¹
Moreover it is too fragmentary to be accepted as an in-
fallible arbiter between the rival traditions But the
authority of P is, as will be seen from the apparatu-3
criticus, a factor by no means to be disregarded. In the
following places it is of first-class importance, and merits
(for the pro Cluentio) the words which Dr. Nohl applies to
it in connection with the pro Milone, “Solus saepe Ciceronis
verba servavit, ubi non modo codd. peccant, sed etiam
Quintilianus ”t ἓ 22, 22 ccccmilicr„2 ξ 129, 14 adfici con-
venire, § 130, 1 multitudini nemini licitum (for multitudinem
illicitum ω), ᾗ 130, 13 iudicia reprehendisse (where all
other codd. insert, after iudicia, the words cum equestri
ordine, erroneously repeated from two lines above), ξ 145
commovet.³ We shall find that, in cases (sometimes doubt-
ful) where the authority of P is accepted as establishing the
true text, the vulgate is as often in agreement with it as

tionem for rationem: ἕ 2, 13 benefici for veneficii.
