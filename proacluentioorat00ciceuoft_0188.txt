128 PRO A. GLUENTIO.

per inam 1.. Sullae vim atque victoriam. The force of
the preposition here seems to be ‘taking advantage of,'
‘ under cover of,' rather than ‘ during the time of.' Cp. quod
per vim hostium aliquid esset aecum, de Off iii. ἓ 103; per
reliyionis vim, pro Dom.‚ ἓ 146; per caedem et vulnera, pro
Sese„ ἓ 91. So also ἓ 108. Vim atque victoriam is an alliter·
ative hend71adys for violentam victoriam: cp. portum ac per-
fuyium‚§ .

in summo timore omnium, not quite correctly trans-
lated, ‘ to the utmost consternation of all the townsfolk‚' but
rather ‘while all the townsfolk were in a state of utter panic.’
It was because of their panio-strichen condition that Oppiani-
cus was able to effect so much.

quattuorviros. This ‘ Council of Four ' constituted in
Municipia a colleyinm, two of the magistrates being styled
quattuorviri iure dicundo and two quattuor-viri aediles. The
government of Coloniae was administered by commissioners,
duoviri iure dicundo and duoviri aediles: to the former the
designation quattuorviri was also sometimes applied.

capitis periculum. For caput see on § 20 (capitis in-
sidias), and for perieulum, ἓ 18. Tr., qui sibi ostentarat,
‘who had threatened to impeach him on a capital charge.’
So iudicium eapitis=an action involving a man’s right of
ciftizenship: poena capilis=the penalty which deprived him
o that right.

A. Aurium, illum qui. Editors here agree on what seems
to be a wrong punctuation, Aurium illum, qui. The demon-
strat-ive should be taken closely with the relative: cp. ἕ 26,
illam cuius virum, etc.

alterum A. Aurium, see on ἓ 23.

quo sequestre dicebatur esse usus, ‘whom he was
alleged to have employed as a depositary.’ The indicative
shows that this description of Vibius is due to Cicero, not to
ms..23382233¹{vazrtffitssfitssssffisszyfflftss «Ῑᾷῗῖἶῗὲἶθέῗ
(sequor) who ‘ held the stakes‚’ receiving the money from the
briber to be paid to the bribed if he fulfilled his pledge.
Cp. ἓξ 72, 87. The bargain was first made by the interpres, or
bribery agent (ξ lOl): after the event the money was paid
over by the divisor or paymaster.

non mediocri, litotes = ‘ the utmost terror.' The read-
ing tenebantur is supported by the similar phrase contineri
melu.
