188, PRO A. eL UENTJO.

missioned Staienus to offer forty thousand sesterces to sixteen
jux-ors ε Cluentius gave fifty thousand to seventeen. Cluentius
was doubtless guilty of bribery as well as Oppianicus, and his
success was probably owing to the fact that he offered more
than his opponent. “ We must contrast‚'' says Mr. Faussett,
“ what Cicero said in the pro Gaea. ξ 28. He is disparaging
the value of Falcula’s evidence. When he gave it, he was
· asked how-many miles (quot millia) Caecina's farm lay from
Rome; and on his replying minus Iooo, ‘less than fifty
miles,' with a roar of laughter the audience cried ipsa esse,
‘ the exact figure.' ‘ For they remembered‚' Cicero says,

< ‘how much he had received in the iudicium Albinianam.'”

de pecuniis repetundis, “ This seems to imply that only
senators were liable under the Lex [Cornelia] de Repetundis
the existing statute on the matter. So also the words at the
beginning of ἓ 148, where Cicero says that if T. Accius (an eques,
v, note on ὅ 62) were impeached under this law, he would
protest, se Zeqe pecuniarum repetundarum non teneri . But
this certainly does ‘not hold in regard to the whole Zeae de

sections of the law de repetundis which related to judicial
corruption was confined to senators, which would be analo-
gous to the similar limitation in the case of the sixth chapter
of the Lex Cornelia de sicariis. ''—Faussett. On this Dr. Reid
remarks that “§ 148 must be read with ἓ 145, si senator iudicio
quemquam circumvenerit, etc. In considering liability under

the Zeqes repetundarum, a distinction must be drawn between ‚

the primary proceedings and the secondary (lites aestimatae).
In connection with the latter, any one, official or not, who
had corruptly touched money in conjunction with the prin-
cipal culprits might be attacked when the inquiry was made
quo ea pecunia pervenerit. This was so even under the early
statutes (Rab. Post. ἓξ 8-10). The Lex Julia gave an enu-
meration of those liable under the primary proceedings z Lex
Iulia repetundarum pertinet ad eas pecunias quas quis in
maqistratu potestate curatione Zeqatione vel quo alio officio
munere ministeriove publico cepit, vel cum ex cohorte cuius
eorum est, Dig. xlviii. 11. 1. It is reasonable to suppose that
a great deal of this was taken from the earlier statutes.
Rab. Post. ξ 12, to which Faussett refers, is not so important
