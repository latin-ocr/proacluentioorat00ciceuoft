260 PRO A. O'LUENTJO.

well suppose that an infinitive has dropped out, and having
regard to what follows in atque illam, Ι haveventured to propose
adesse z cp. Larino advolavit, ξ 18. The translation will
then be, ‘ Here is a woman from Larinum ; and she is on her
way from the mare superum to Rome in order to be able,’
etc. Possit, which has much manuscript support, follows as
a matter of course instead of posset.

Mr. Fausset adopts M iiller’s conjecture, Mulierem quandam
Larinatem illim usquc a mari supero quo facilius posset.
But to say nothing of the difficulty involved in quandam, and
the MS. authority for Larino, the juxtaposition of illim usque
α mari supero is awkward : and posset, with proficisci, is hard
to construe. For Larino—Larinas cp. ἓ 36.

§ 193. paene dicam, future: see on quod timide dicam,
{palm {efficere dicam, iudices, Sest. ξ 22, cp. de Or. ii ἓ 15:

consistendi potestas: ‘ there was not a single town in
which she was permitted to make a halt.' A slightly
different use of consistere occurs in ἓ 108, consistere in dicendo,
of ‘commanding a hearing.' The idea common to both is
that of ‘ standing one's ground,' ‘getting a root-hold) Sassia
was made to ‘ move on.'

ex tot hospitibus. Not of Sassia's ‘guest friends ' the
amici et hospites of ἓ 176: the context here shows that the
reference is to inns and iun-keepers (cp. hominem multorum
hospitem, ἓ 163). Tr. “There was not a hostelry of all the
many upon that road where the host did not run to avoid her
baleful glance.'’

§ 194. nostrum. All MSS. but two have nostrorum, a.
form which, while characteristic of earlier Latin, is not likely
to have been used by Cicero here. This is a case where MS.
authority (depending possibly on some minute contraction)
cannot be accepted as weighing against established usage.

appellarit. So§ 71, ut ceteros appellet quibuscum loqui
consuesset, of ‘approaching‚' or ‘making overtures to' any-
one. For a different use, cp. on ἓ 18.

occultiora: ‘a deep secret) For this ‘absolute' com·
parative cp. on alienior, § 162.

furorem atque crudelitatem: ‘insensate rancour,'
‘ rancorous frenzy. '

LXIX. § 19⁵. quosdam alios deos. Commentators do not
seem to have observed that deos in this sentence cannot be
disconnected from the same word in the preceding sentence.
Halm’s emendation quasi aliquos deos, accepted by Miiller and
