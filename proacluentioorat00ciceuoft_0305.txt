him even to open his mouth during the present case, whereas,

with regard to Cluentius (huic autem), he cannot possibly want
for accusers so long as his mother 1s alive. ' Oppianicus junior,

Cicero says, was by no means so formidable a person that
Cluentius should have wished to make away with him: while
there would always be others. The argument is, as again at
ἓ 169, that there was no mot-ive for the crime.

An ut de causa eiua, etc. An introduces an alternative
(ἓὲ 60, 136) z if it was not fear that prompted the alleged attempt
at poisoning, was it infatuation? An (hoc fecit) ut accederet?
Eius is difficult. It has been proposed to take it with
periculi in the sense of ‘ the danger of the former prosecution'
(for poisoning Oppianicus the elder). If it were not for the
antithesis de causa ad causam, we might confidently con-
strue de causa eius. On the whole, looking to the analogy of
huiusce periculi, ἕ 117, sine huius periculo, ἓ 118, Ι incline to
take eius as masc„ and to translate (literally) “was it that
while nothing of the risk to Cluentius should depart from the
case, there should be added to the case a new charge.’'

illa frequentia: ablative of circumstance. For the
omission of the preposition (found in many Mss.) cp. Leq.
A9r. ii, ἓ 55, hac vestrum frequentia, and such common
phrases as summa- hominum frequentia, tanco conventu
hominum et frequentia.

non committam ut videar, etc. ‘1 shall not make the
blunder of giving the impression that I have hinted at more
than I am prepared to state.’ Cp. the use of the figure
‘ Omission,' ἓ 99.

magnum crimen, is explained as meaning ‘a monstrous
(μέγα) accusation.' But we should expect the phrase to
mean rather ⁴ a serious charge ' : cp. maioribus criminibus, ἓ 9,
crimen tantum ac tam manffestum, ἕ 50. On the whole, it
see11111s to me that crimen (which is found only in ST) is doubt-
ful ere.

erud-ior: ‘suffering from indigestion': an absolute com-
parative, like alienior, ἓ 162. So crudi tumidique lavemur,
Hor. Ep. i. 6. 61: cp. Sat. i. 5. 49. Cic. de Orat. i. ἕ 124:
Juv. i. 142. The word properly means ‘ raw,' and is connected
with cruor, κρέας, etc.
