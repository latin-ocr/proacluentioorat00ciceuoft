non suis commodis, sed. etiam, etc. This frequent anti-
thesis (cp. de Off i. ἓ 22 ; de Fan. ii. ξ 45 ; Mur. ξ 83) was
rhetorically expanded by Lucan when he said (of Cato), Nec

a sense parallel to that in which defendere occurs in the pre-

avarissimi atque audacissimi. This is the reading of
most MSS„ but many editors have followed the first hand in
S. in bracketing or omitting atque audacissimi. Mr. Faussett
regards these words as an obvious interpolation, which
weakens the force of avarissimi in the context. On another
view they appear to be quite in place: Oppianicus not only
was avaricious but would take any means to gratify his
avarice. The use of audacissimi therefore seems to anticipate

§ 45. bona eius omnia ad matrem esse ventura. We must
infer from this that Cluentius's sister (ἕ 11) had died, or else
had married with conventio iu manum, and so had ceased to
belong to the Cluentian family. Otherwise she would have
inherited as one of the ‘next-of-kin' (consanyuiuei) if her
brother had died intestate. As to Sassia, she too would have
taken as next-of-kin, for the law prescribed that a woman
marrying with conventio in manum should rank as a daughter,
and, therefore, she would have been in effect a sister of the
supposed intestate for purposes of inheritance. But in the
meantime she had contracted two additional marriages, and
this must have barred her claim to hereditas or full succession.
All she could rank for would be what is defined in§ 165 as
