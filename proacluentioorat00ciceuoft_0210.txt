loquebantur, re quidem in universam rem publicam. Nagels-
bach& 195 G. pp. 729-730.

tota accusatione: abl. of place without preposition, as
often even in prose with totus, medius, So Caes. Β. G. vi.
37, totis trepidatur eastris. These words apply to both parts
of the antithesis, verbo re quidem vera et periculo.

neque id obscure ferebat, ‘and he was at no pains to
conceal the fact.' So Liv. xxii. 14 acl fin„ Ac haud dubie
serebant Iinnucium Fabio duci praelaturos, i.e. they declared
unhesitatingly, etc.

frequens, adverbial, ‘he turned up regularly in court.'
So pro Bos-c. ἕ 16, erac ille Romae frequens: in V err. v, ἓ 33,
in quibus (castris) cum frequens fuisset: ele Sen. §38‚ venio in
senatum frequens: Tac. Ann. xiii. 35, Ipse ...frequens adesse.
For the plural, see on ἓ 49.

advocabat, ‘ he kept beating up his supporters.' So
advocatus, ‘a backer’ of one who lends his countenance to
a friend by attending in court to support him. Cp. Phil. i'.
16, Vellem adesset Antonius modo sine advocatis : Dem. de Cor.
275, 20, οἱ ἐκ παρακλήσεως συγκαθήμενοι.

hoc ipso in loco, i.e. on the benches reserved for the
defence. So in hisce subselliis, pro Rosc. Am. § 59. Cicero regu-
larly uses the preposition with sedere, instead of the simple
ablative. Cp. ἕ 147.

suspensus incertusque vultus, ‘ his restless and anxious
looks.' The same combination of adjectives occurs in de
Leq. A9r. ii. ἓ66. Εἰιθρεωαεεμετέωρος, ‘distreus’

XX. § ⁵5. 111 consilium iri, impersonal. Tr. ‘When the
time came for the jury to deliberate 011 their verdict.' So the
presiding judge was said mittere in consilium, ξ 83 : cp. ἓξ 74,
75, in which latter passage the phrase consumitur in consilium
seems to show that the jury had an opportunity of retiring
to consult, though it is possible to hold that such expressions
are merely technical phrases indicating that the jury pro-
ceeded to record their votes, leaving their seats no doubt,
but not necessarily retiring for consultation. Below Itum
est in consilium. Omnibus sententiis, etc., reads as if it were
in responding to some roll-call that the verdict became at
once apparent. Cp. pro Gaea-..s 29. · The word consilium is
ἷῖἓιέὶὲᾟζὲἓῗὲἶᾱοξεἭὲξὲξθεῖἓῗξῗῗῗέἒ ξὲἒῖἴᾱὶῃὲῗὲἕῗξηέῗὲ
(quaesitor).

ex lege Cornelia. This clause must be construed with
quaesivit, not with quaesitor. The provision was afterwards
repealed: cp. ἓ 75, quae tum erac potestas.
