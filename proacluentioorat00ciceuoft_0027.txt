it must have been practised either by Cluentius or else
by Oppianicus (ξ 64). But all the evidence points to an
alternative supposition, viz. that both were guilty, and
that Cluentius overbribed his rival. This theory derives
additional support from a passage in the Verrines, in
which the orator distinctly states that Staienus had
taken a bribe from both prosecutor and defendant:
inventus est senator qai, cum iudex esset, in eodem iudicio
et ab reo pecuniam acciperet quam iudicibus divideret et ab
accusatore atreum condemnarent, Verr. i., ξ 39.

Except so far as it may be indicated in a phrase
which Cicero lets drop in the course of his narrative,¹
the fact that the issue turned on a single vote is
nowhere distinctly stated in the text. But there is a
passage in the pro Caecina which makes this a
certainty ε cum si uno minus damnarent condemnari reus
non posset (ἓ 29). The transference of a single vote,
that is to say, would have resulted in a tie-16 to
163 and this would have involved another hearing
(ampliatio). The majority in favour of a conviction
was therefore 17 to 15.2

The proper interpretation of ἓ 107 is an important
factor in determining this result. N ine names are
there enumerated, and these have been taken by some
commentatore (as, for example, Professor Ranisay) to
be the names of jurors who voted “Guilty.'’ But this
view is not supported by the context. We know from
indications in other parts of the speech that eight
jurors who gave a hostile verdict were suspected of
having been infiuenced by bribery—Staieniis, Bulbus,
Gutta, Popilius, Falcula, Aquilius, Scaevola, and

acquittal, in addition to that of Staienus.
