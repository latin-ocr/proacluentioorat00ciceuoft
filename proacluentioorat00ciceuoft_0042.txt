really possible. Nowhere does he state that skilled
lawyers and courts had not supported a different view
of the matter; and the omission is most suspicions,
Next he catches at a statement made by the opposing
counsel that it was expedient to give the law a wider
interpretation. When he finally comes face to face
with the actual words used in the Sixth Section, he
does not deal with them like a man who has a strong
case. It is almost certain that he does not quote in full.
For example, it is hardly to be supposed that Sulla,
when he incorporated in his enactment earlier provisions,
relieved the relations of the senators from liability.
In view of the incompleteness of the quotations, we
should have expected a direct and even triumphant
assertion that the statute contained not a word which
the other side could quote3 but this we do not get.
Cicero insinuates rather than states (ἓ 149) that he
will deal with all the arguments which his opponent
had urged in connexion with the Sixth Section of the
Cornelian LaW. But no one who is well acquainted with
his manner will believe that he has carried this out.
In the discussion which we do get there are obvious
weaknesses, irrelevancies, and omissions. The conten-
tions quoted from the other side are all directed to
expediency3 but the opposing counsel must have appealed
to legal authority and decided cases. Had he omitted
to do so, or been unable to do so, Cicero would have
ridden over him roughshod. But the problem is
‘res longi subselli' (to quote a phrase of Pompeius,
reported by Cicero), and we have only been able to
present in part the reasons for believing that the dust
which Cicero boasted of having thrown in the eyes of
the jury was intended to render them blind rather to
the law than to the facts on which the issue turned.”

It may be doubted whether even Cicero would have
