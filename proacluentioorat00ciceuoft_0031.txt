cases of senatorial corruption, he alludes to the liti-s
aestimatio at the trial of Scaevola as a proof that bribery
had been practised against Oppianicus: 2 Verr. i.‚ ξ 157,
where he accuses Verres of having falsified the entries in
his official register, in order to conceal his connivance at
the crime of J unius (quod salsum codicem protuleris).
Again in the pro Caecina, ἐξ 28, 29, he dwells on the
informality of which Falcula had been guilty (for the
purpose of disparaging him as a witness), in language
very different from that which he uses in his speech before
us. The accusation of inconsistency which had evidently
been levelled against him on the ground of such utter-
ances as these, he endeavours to rebut by various argu-
ments, especially in § 139: just as he tries to demolish
the weight of the praeiudicia against his client by showing
that they were due to the invidia which then prevailed.
There can be little doubt that this change of attitude is

(13.0. 122) had transferred to the Equites from the Senate

legislatiou. The only attempts to interfere with it were
the Lex Servilia of 13.c. 106 (cp. ξ 140), which provided
for associating the Senate with the Equites, but which
did not continue long in operation3 a similar motion
brought forward by the tribune L. Drusus, in Bc. 91 (see
on ἓ 153); and the Lex Plautia of B.c. 89, which proposed
that each of the thirty-five tribes should furnish fifteen
persons of any standing whatever. It was only in B.c. 81
that a Lex Cornelia again transferred the iudicia to the
Senate. But the corruption which marked the senatorial
resqz‘me, and which is represented as having culminated in
the trial before J unius, led to the agitation of which we
