which is not enumerat-ed in the list of those consulted
by Classen.1 There were also eight Palatine mss„
said by Classen (p. xiii.) to have been negligently
collated by Gruter, and two codd. Francii compared
by Graevius. ·

Classen's review of the evidence of his twenty-six
manuscripts led him to the belief that there had been
two recensions of the text, and that it was the inferior
of these that had passed into most mss. and editions,
forming what was still in his time the vulgate, with
corrections. Recognizing the recension embodied in
s and ⁷1¹ as the superior of 13110 two, Classen based his
text 111 the main on these two manuscripts. The
Florentine codex (Τ) was already known to collators:
Classen's special service was the discovery that, where
it differed from the vulgate, it was generally supported
by the Salisburyensis (s), and that, while both were late
manuscripts, they were probably derived from a common
archetype of older date. He therefore included s and
'r (along with Ρ) 111 a class by themselves as superior
to all others.

Classen's estimate of the importance of s for the pro
Cluentio is at variance with the opinion expressed in
regard to this codex by editors of some of Cicero's

other speeches. Thus, most recently‚ Mr. Clark, in his ’

Introduction to the pro Milone, has endeavoured to prove
that s “should disappear from the list of first-class
authorities.'' While thoroughly vulgar in its basis, it
is described as containing additions and variants charac-
teristic of the better family of Mss.‚—changes which
have come in ab extra and have been grafted on the
vulgar stock. Mr. Clark supposes “that in the fifteenth
