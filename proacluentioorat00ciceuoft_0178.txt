118 PRO A. CLUE'NTIO.

ineolumi, of one who is ‘ unattainted.' The repetition
of the preposition pro, which occurs in all the MSS. except
one, is not unnatural: it emphasizes the second of the two
points which made Cluentius a contrast to Oppianicus.

pro quo dicimus. This phrase brings the question out
of the region of the abstract (quis dubitare debeat contra
damnatum pro incolumi dicere .? cum illi in quem dicitur)
into the region of the concrete, i-e. ‘ my client Cluentius)

nihil possit offensionis accipere, ‘cannot meet with a
reverse.’ So offendere, ἓξ 63, 98: offensio is a ‘blow in the
shape of an adverse judgment ' (Faussett). The alternative
reading, huic nihil possit offensionis accedere, merits con-
sideration, and cannot be dismissed on Classen's argument
that accedere would imply that Cluentius had already suffered
a similar reverse. In Att. i. 16, 9, we may render dolor
accessit bonis viris by ‘ the boni have received an added stimulus
of resentment,' but in ξ 83 of this speech the word is used
simply as the opposite of discedere: ab eo invidiam discedere
aliquando ad quem numquam culpam accessisse videtis.

molestia. The alternative reading here is dolore, which
occurs in the majority of the Mss. ε for the source of the con-
fusion, see on domo, ἓ 27.

§ 11. ostentatione of his desire to ‘figure' as a prosecutor:
gloria = ‘ sels-conceit,' ‘ vainglory‚' ‘ bumptiousness.'

long-ius, adverb: cp. ξ 58, alte petito prooemio. For
petam, Quint. iv, l, 79, gives repetam, which may be right,
as the prefix re is a variable quantity in MSS„ e. 9. 111 ξ 24, 19
P has renuntiant, rightly ς s'r nuntiant. Cp. ἕ 66 and ad Fam.
i. 9. 4, altius paulo rationem consiliorum meorum repetam
necesse est. On the other hand, pro O'aec. ἓ 10, si sorte videtur
altius initium rei demonstrandae petisse.

municipii Larinatis. Larinum (now Larino) was a
Samnite township in the territory of the Frentani, due east of
Rome, and about 12 miles from the coast.

nobilitate, ‘noble birth) So nobili, at the end of the
section, ‘of high rankg': cp. ἓξ 69, 109, 112.

facile princeps. Facile may here be an ‘ accretion ’z
its omission in Quint. iv. 2, 130, as well as in ST, is significant.
Cicero is often content with princeps alone in similar passages ε
Quir. ἓ 16 ; Verr. iii. §56 ; Phil. xiii. 30. For facile princeps,
cp. Vle. i. 564, de Or. iii. 1560, de Div. ii. §87 z facile primus,
Rosc. m. ἓ 15.
