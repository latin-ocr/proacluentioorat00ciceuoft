huius ordinis, i.e. of the knights. Cicero now addresses
himself directly to the knights, whose ‘ class feeling' he was
desimus of exciting.

hoc metu proposito, the fear, namely, of being made
ῗιῐιιξῖῗζὶὲὦὶῖο a statute technically applicable ·to senatorial

evellere aculeum, ‘ to pluck out the sting ' of your rigor·
ous procedure. The idea is that the jurors will be harmiess
when their ‘ stings ’ have been removed ε there does not seem
to be necessarily any reference to the well-known fact (Virg.
Geory. iv. 236) that bees often lose their stings, with fatal
results, in the effort to drag them out of the wound they have
made. For the figure cp. pro Cael. ξ 29, quos aculeos habeat
severitas gravitasque vestra.

ς 153. de eo quod coierit aut consenserit, ‘ on a charge of
combination or conspiracy.'

LVI. Ο viros fortes: for the acc. of exclamation, see on ἕ 15.

Μ. Druso. It was in B.0. 91 that M. Livius Drusus, the
son of the opponent of C. Gracchus, came forward with
various legislative proposals, some of which were designed to
check the corruption that had so long marked the equestrian
administration of the iudicia. He proposed to constitute a
new Album iudicum of three hundred senators and three
hundred knights, the selected knights being probably at the
same time included in the now attenuated ranks of the senate.
He also sought to provide a special tribunal for the trial of
such jurors as had been or should be guilty of receiving bribes.
Drusus wished in fact to make the equites responsible for
judicial corruption in the past (Bab. Post. ἓ 13) : the Sempron-
ian law of B.c. 124 (see on ξ 151) must have required extension
of some kind. The knights resisted ι intelleqebant enim ea le9e
equestrem ordinem non teneri, ξ 154. The measures of Drusus
were cancelled immediately after his assassination.

cum ina cuncta quae tum erat nobilitate, ‘ with the
whole aristocracy of the day,' which included M. Aemilius
Scaurus, the princeps senatus, the orator Crassus (ἓ 140), M.
Antonius, the augur Scaevola, Q. Lutatius Catulus, and others.
The most bitter opponent of Drusus was the consul L.
Marcius Philippus. All MSS. give cum ille nihil aliud quam
cum illa cuneta: perhaps una eum?

ceterique eiusdem ordinis. The reading of εἰ· is ceterique
eiuscemodi ordinis: other codd. give huiuscemodi. Eiusdem
ordinis is sufficiently near eiuscemodi ordinis, assuming a
dittography, to justify its insertion in the text. Alternatively
huiusce vestri ordinis might be suggested. Cicero is here
