194 PRO Α. CLUENTIO.

nobilitatis dig-nitatem, ‘ the high standing which rank
,confersff The nobiles were all who had the ius imaqinum:
see Οηῐιῗθζῗέ cp. on ἕ 152. superbia, ‘uppishness.'

5 112. intolerantia, ‘ unbearable presumption.' The word
is passive in classical Latin3 i.e. not ‘ intolerance,' but
‘ unendurableness.'

ita tulerunt ut: see on ἓ 49. Tr. “ People did put up
with it, considering that he ought to be allowed the benefit
of any natural advantages.’'

XLI. illuc, i. e. to the trial of Fidiculanius.

tu quid tum esse existimas iudicatum. This is the
reading of 81⁸3 the other MSS. give quaero quid tum. But
quae-ro could not stand parenthetically in such a context ι it is
misleading to print it between commas in ξ 114 below, as
Miiller does. Klotz and many editors adopt quaeso: cp. on
ἓξ 30, 66. In view of its omission in ST, it is simplest to
assume that the word had no place in the original text. One
is reminded that the marginal adscript- quaere has sometimes
found its way into the body of a Ms.: see Lindsay, Latin
Textual Emendation‚ p. 61. This may be a case in point.

certe gratis iudicasse. This is Cicero's own reJ’oinder
(made on behalf of Accius) to the question just put:
‘ surely that Fidiculanius had taken no bribe for voting as he
did.’ Then follows the sentence, ‘ But you will tell me,’ etc.

were the work of injustice,’ etc. ‘ Granted‚’ Accius replies,
‘ Falcula may have been innocent.' ‘ Now, then,' eries Cicero,
‘this is equivalent to saying that,’ etc. (lam erqo, et sqq.)
There is a difficulty about the sentence beginning Iam erqo
aliqui. The substantial identity of the first clause with the
third (Iam putaretur* aliqui) might be regarded with
suspicion were it not for the deliberate assonance of con-
(lemnavit—condemnarent-aeondemnasse. It may be that in
the words Aliqui Oppianicum ¹qratia condemnavit we have
again a case of the transference of index words, showing the
contents of the paragraph, into the body of the text. Cp.
the instances already commented on at ἓξ 58, 72.

Iam ergo. Tr. “ We have, then, now come to this, that
some one condemned Oppianicus without being bribed.’'

§ ua. aliqui, substantival: contrast ἐξ 7, 184.

Θοε. This may be no more than a rhetorical plural ε cp.
{ngsszzk iim} 39, where the plural senatores is used. See on ε
