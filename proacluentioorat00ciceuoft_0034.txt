xxx PRO A. OLUENTIO.

Venefieis, passed cire. 13.c. 81, was to inflict penalties for
murder and poisoning. It also contained a sectiou (the
Sixth Chapter) which dealt with the crime of conspiring
to procure the conviction of a person innocently accused
on a capital charge—threatening penalties against “ those
who should be proved to have given false evidence, or
induced others to give false evidence, or have combined
or conspired in any way to procure the conviction of an
innocent man when criminally impeached, or, if acting in
the capacity of a judge or juror, have received money for
that purpose ’' (Ra-msam} The peculiarity of this sec-tion
-—and this is of the highest importance for the proper
interpretation of Oicero’s argument—was that the equites
and the lower orders generally were excluded from its
operation: it applied only to senators and to the holders
of certain offices. Reference may be made, among other
passageS, to ξ 155, omues id agamus ut liaeo quam primum

Many students of the pro Cluentio have been of opinion
that no charge was made against the defendant under the

2I.e., the quaestio inter sicarios, ἓ 147. The usual explanation
of this phrase (cp. inter sicarios deferre, accusare, defendere) is
that there was no substantive to express murder, corresponding to
veneficium, peculatus, ete, and that, as it was impossible to say
sicae, or de sica desewe, the short phrase inter sicarios deferre and
other analogous forms were employed for what would have been,
at full length, ita deferre ut nomen alicuius inter sicarios deferatur.
It has been suggested, however (see Mr. Faussett's note on ἓ 21),“
that inter sicarios may be a quasi-local designation‚ ‘in the
Assassination Gourt’: cp. inter falcarios, Cat. i.‚ ἓ 8, ‘in the

sickle-maker’s street'3 and inter limem-ios, Liv. xxxv. 41, ‘in the
carpenter's street‚’ or ‘in the timber market.’
