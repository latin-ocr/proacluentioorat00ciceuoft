honestissime: so honeste, §49. Falcula left the court

Adducti iudices sunt, etc„ ‘The court was brought to .

believe that .' Adducti here = adducti ad iudicandum, or
ut crederent, as is quite plain from the analogous passages in
de Fin. i. 5. 14 (where see Madvig's note), and ad Att. xi.
16. 2. Similar examples of brachylogy are not uncommon,
especially in poetry. Cp. de Or. i. ἓ 115, ita dico ut possit
for ita dico nt dicam posse: Lucr. iii. 765, Scilicet in tenero
tenerascere corpore mentem G'onfuyient. For other cxx„ see

constarent. There need be no difficulty about the per-
sonal construction, though Lambinus wished to read constaret
and Muller approves, referring to Rosa. ἓ 118, where maleficiis
quaein illo constat esse is the reading now adopted. There
is an analogy to the personal construction (with the infinitive)
in the occurrence of a ne clause in Le9. Ayr. 2, ξ 102, qaae
timebatis ea ne accidere possent provisa sunt. Constarent
should be retained also in de Dom. §139. The personal
construction of discrepare in ξ 122 may be compared.

about (cp. hominum rumor, ἓ 28). Aucupari is a favourite figure
with Cicero and Plautus: cp. Leyq. iii. 35, omnes rumusculos
