NOTES. 187

Taking the text as I have proposed to constitute it, the
general sense is clear. “ Ι waive this acquittal‚” says Cicero,
“for even though he had not rendered himself liable to the fine
in question, it is still quite possible that he may have taken
a bribe while serving as a juror, just as Staienus, though he
had taken a bribe, was never impeached under the same
statute (i.e. the statute which was applicable to Falcula’s
graver offence of judicial corruption and to his own: see
§ 104). That indictment (crimen illud, viz. that he had taken
a bribe) could not roperly be made in the court before which
he was impeached> (proprium quaestionis eius non fuit).
But as to the facts: what was the charge made against
Fidiculanius at his second trial? He was charged, directly
and expressly‚ with having taken money from Cluentius.
His acquittal is therefore very strong evidence in favour of
m cient.

what follows (proprium crimen, etc.) it is rather against this
emendation that we have eadem fere Zeqe et crimine a few

Staienus was a senator as well as Falcula.

Other emendations are: iudicandam pecuniam, qua capta

quaestionis eius. Most edd. take this sentence of Staienus,
and explain quaestio of the court in which Staienus was tried
for maiestas. But it is better to understand the orator as
referring to Falcula. The statement, in fact, resumes non
numero hanc absolutionem3 the fact that Falcula was acquitted
on the first occasion cannot benefit Cluentius, because bribery
could not have formed a count in the indictment. Then follows
the abrupt question ι “ But what of the merits? What was

times as much as Oppianicus proposed to give each juror

hint of the real truth. The correct reading may be HS IOOO,
which would = HS quinquaqinta milium. Oppianicus com-
