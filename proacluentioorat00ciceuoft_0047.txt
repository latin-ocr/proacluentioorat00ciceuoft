(qaae tunc), and from 5 176, 4 (quendam) to ἓ 182, 13
(laonestzzssimorum).

W, the Codex Helmstadius, n. 304, a manuscript which
is most nearly alliecl to M (see Wrampelmeyer, Progr.
Clausthal‚ Hannover, 1881).

Ι11 addition to the above, there are many other codices
in various European libraries, all of late date, and
possessing little or no authority. Classen cites various
readings from nineteen such codd. in addition to the seven
already named. I have examined for myself the Mss.
in the British Museum, viz. Harl. 2681, 4852, 5428 (anno
1470), 16980, Ar. 236, Burn. 155, 157, 159—with little
result except so far as Ar. 236 may be held to confirm
the reading quosdam alios cleos ἓ 195, previously
attributed to Lambinus (1520-1572), and my proposed
omission of communi Italiae pace, immediately below
(v. acl loen). To these may be added the Oxford Mss„
for which Classen depended on the faulty collation
published in the Clarendon Press edition of 1783 : Coll.
Nov. ccxlix., a codex closely related to s (see Clark,
Introd. pro Milone, xxxiV. sq.): Coll. Ball. ccxlviii. A
(Classen's m), an Italian MS. of the 15th century, with
copious omissions supplied in the margin: Digby 231 :1
Laud. Lat. 48 (anno 1450-—Classen's i): 0011. Line.
xxxix. (Classen's l): 0011. Νον. cccii.: 0011. Linc. xl.
(Classen’s w). The two last agree in breaking off at
ᾖ 192, 14 ne forte mater: so too, Classen⁷s q, one of the
Laurentian codices.

Lastly, there was a Codex S. Victoris, believed by
Classen to have been used by Lambinus, and collated
also by Gulielmius. I find it cited in what is the earliest
separate edition of the pro Cluentio, that of Sylvius,

1This MS. is wrongly cited by Mr. Clark as Digby 19. Ι11 the
Cluentius it shows none of the marginal additions which he has
noted as characterising its version of the pro Milone (Introduction,
p. xxxiv.).
