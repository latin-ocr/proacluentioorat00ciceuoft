l. ⁴ PRO A. CLUENTIO.

out of over a hundred places where, often with absolutely
no difference in the meaning, the order oi?¹ words varies
in the two traditions—a phenomenon which certainly
suggests the inference that, in the archetype of either of
the two, the copyist must have set himself deliberately
to alter the collocation. In g 21, 9 P exists to reinforce
ST,—lieredem fecit PST, fecit heredem w: so ξ 22, 15 re-
ciperandi filii PST, fil. reeip. ω (recup.): ἓ 36, 13 dicere
milti PSTM, mihi dicere w: ξ 92, 7 idem illud PST, illud
idem w: ibid. 8 inquit idcireo PST, ideireo inquit ω.
Similarly the order in ST is to be preferred, ἓ 70, 8 mihi
ipsi iyitur ST, milti i9itur ipsi w: ξ 81, 25 (see note on
ipsam): ξ 143, 18 imprudentes videlieet S, videlicet impru-
dentes w: ibid. 21 boc tibi ST, and Quint„ tibi hoc w:
certainly in ἓ 192, 9 misisset ipsa ST, ipsa misisset ω. At
ἓ 25, 5 and ἓ 171, 7 the appearance of alios, aliud in the
vulgate seems to point- to the record of a variant: See
note on the latter passage. Against ST, on the other
hand, must be quoted g 20, 19 vos volui Ρω, volui vos ST:
ἓ 121, 5 numquam sibi ω, sibi numquam ST: g 21, 8 est
mortuus ω, mortuus est ST.

And ST contain many errors, including some wrong
corrections: ey. ἓ 20, 16 retineretur for the vulgate
teneretur (which may be a reason for rejecting evitaret im-
mediately below in favour of the vulgate vitaret) : ἓ 40, 8
foranum for circumforanum: ἓ 43, 13 antea for tantae:
§46, 10 Larinati for Aletrinati: ἓ 50, 3 constituebantur
for coniciebantur: g 62, 21 aies innocentis for aye si

vulgate to Mater nihil mali misera suspicans mittit: while in two
MSS. (Harl. 2681, 0011. Lino. xl.) Ι have noted the reading attri-
buted to the editio princeps by Classen, Mater nihil mali suspicans
misera mittit. Sometimes it was the addition of an omitted word
in the margin that led to the displacement: thus, ἓ 13, 22 se sine
scelere ST, sine scelere se ω, where sine scetere (omitted altogether in
classen’s n) may be recorded as appearing in the margin of Ood. Ball.
