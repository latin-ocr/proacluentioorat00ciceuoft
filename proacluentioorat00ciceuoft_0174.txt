iuris peritissimus : and such expressions as “ Painting is mute
poetry‚ poetry is eloquent painting.'’

ς 6. de ipsa causa.- ‘ about the facts of the case. '

inc1pio. For the tense cp. ἓ 8, ante quam de causa dico.
Similarly ἓ 117, and pro Milone, ξ 7, Sed aute quam ad eam
orationem venio. .videutur ea esse rejfutauda, where Dr. Reid
says that the future after aute quam‘ ‘is Plautine and Teren-
tian but not classical.''

haec postulo. The subsequent government ‚of postulo
should be carefully noted, embodied as it is in the three com-
ponent parts of the period (α) primum.. ut ne quid.. ‚adferatis
(cp. on§ 16); (β) deiude.. .ue repuquetis; (γ) tum autem.. ,ne
ipsi.. .subiciatis. In the first part I have altered the printing

of the text so as to show that id is not a direct accusative Ι

’ after postulo (like the haec that precedes it), subsequently
expanded into ut ue quid adferatis : the whole phrase id quod
ἶὲἷὲῑίῗέξὲἴῖἔι est should be taken together as appositional and

auctoritatem, of the moral influence that goes with
official position. .

nisi iudicabimus ac si deferemus. Acis omitted by
all editors (except Faussett) as not found in the best MSS. , and
it has been argued that one or other of two clauses which are
practically equivalent must be an adscript. But the two are
mutually complementary‚ and Mr. Faussett aptly compares ne
gepuynetis eamque remittatis, below (‘ instead of resisting

ismiss ’).

convellet labefactabit. The first is the stronger word
of the two, denoting as it does the effort to tear up or pluck
out by a straight pull, whereas labefactare is to dislodge by
shaking. The words are found in reverse order in the parallel
passage, ad Fam. v. 13, 2, quae c09itatio cum mihi nou omuino
excidisset. .vi tamen tempestatum et concursu calamitatum erat
aliquantum labefactata atque convulsa: cp. pro Bab. Perd„
§3. Tr. ‘If reason uproots, if discourse undermines, or else
if truth wrests from you any impressions you may have
already formed.' Literally, ‘if you have already formed any
impressions, do not· resist if reason uproots,' etc. The two
conditional clauses are not co- extensive, the first (si.. ,com-
prehendistis) being wider than the second (si .. ,extorquebit).
