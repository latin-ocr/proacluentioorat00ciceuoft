whom Papia was bringing up in retirement at Teanum,
are promptly (lisposed of, and with this proof of affection
Sassia would seem to have been content, as the eldest
son of Oppianicus, who bore his name, survived, as has
been said, to institute proceedings against Cluentius. The
fact that he was now heir to the whole family property of
his grandmother, Dinaea, was probably a sufficient reason
for not including him in the list of victims (ξὲ 27-8).
This recital of the crimes of Oppianicus is presented
by Cicero with the obvious view of predisposing the
jury to believe that he was quite capable of having
attempted, as was alleged, the life of Cluentius. It is,
ν in fact, the so called probabile ex vita (ἐξ ΪΟ-42)-13116
argument in proof of a man's guilt, drawn from his
known life and character. Oppianicus had had five
wives: the first 116 poisoned, two 116 seems to have
divorced, one died a natural death, and the fifth was
Sassia. Reference may bex made to ἓ 125 for a general
summary of his career of crime: from the indictment con-
tained in that section it will appear that he was charged
with having murdered, or at least procured the murder of,
no fewer than eleven persons—his first wife, his brother,
a brother-in-law, two of his own 60116, a cousin, his
mother-in-law, besides Asuvius of Larinum (ξ 36), and
three of his fellow-citizens (ξ 25). - Η6 had, moreover,
according to Cicero, forged a will and bribed a jury.
It may be that all the counts in Cicero's impeach—
ment of Oppianicus could not have been substantiated
if the dead man had been present to answer for him-
self. Certainly it should be noted that, while the
orator evidently wishes to produce the impression that
Oppianicus had practised wife-murder on a large scale
(ἓὲ 52, 125), 13116 death of his first wife Cluentia is the only
case he actually cites. And we may well ask how, if
Oppianicus had really been guilty of so many enormities,
