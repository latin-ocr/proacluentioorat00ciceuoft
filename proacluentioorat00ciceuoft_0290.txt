quae a me desiderari arbitror, ‘ the argument which is,
Ι think, expected of me,’ i.e. by my audience. The alter-
native reading quae te a me desiderare arbitror would involve
au inexplicable transition from Cluentius, (of whom it has just

been said that he refused to shelter himself behind the letter
of the law), to Accius the opposing counsel.

not leave it unsaid.'

eius modi est ut, etc.‚ ‘ it only amounts to this, that we
require a thorough change in our laws.' It has been sug-
gested (by Orelli, Hartman) that eis (after commutatis) should
go out, as forming a false antithesis to his. But there is a
particular reference to isdem leyibus in what goes before.
“ We require a change,’' Cicero says, “in those statutes which

retain the reading of the MSS. 3 most editors read hoc re-

recusavit ne quo: some also gratuitously insert non before

good Latin for “ What senator ever found fault with this,
namely, that,'' etc. As to the latter part of the sentence,
its meaning and construction will be better appreciated if it
is stated inde endently as follows: cum altiorem ‚qradum
dissuitatis ὂεηρέεἰο populi Romani est consecutus, eo se putat
durioribus leyum condicionibus uti oportere, “ When he has
gained by the favour of his countrymen a higher grade of
rank, he thinks that he ought to accept correspondingly
more stringent (eo durioribus) legal restrictions.’' The
senator, Cicero says, cheerfully accepts all the disadvan-
tages of his lot 3 these disadvantages are outweighed by the
countervailing advantages of office and distinction (honoris et
