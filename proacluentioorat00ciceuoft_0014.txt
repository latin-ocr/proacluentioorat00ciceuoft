x PRO A. CL UENTIO.

Such are the elements which go to compose the drama
that is enacted in the speech before us—a speech which,
apart from the interest that attaches to it as a revelation
of the conditions of social life in ancient Italy, will always
hold a foremost place in oratorical literature as repre-
senting the high-water mark of Ciceronian eloquence.

Tm: STORY UNFOLDED IN CICERo's SPEEcn.

A. Cluentius Habitus) the defendant, had lost his
father in the year Rc. 88, when he was a boy of fifteen.
His sister Cluentia married her cousin, A. Aurius
Melinus3 and the first stage in the rupture between
Cluentius and his mother was brought about by the
circumstances which destroyed this marriage. Sassia,
falling in love with her son-in-law, induced him to
divorce Cluentia, and marry her instead.

Here enters the villain of the piece, Oppianicus 13118
elder, who eventually succeeded Aurius Melinus as
Sassia’ s (third) husband, and thus became the step· -father
of Cluentius.

Melinus had a kinsman, M. Aurius, who was. murdered‚
and Oppianicus became suspected of having been con-
cerned in his.death (§ 23). The previous record of
Oppianicus was a bad one. His first wife had been a
Cluentia, a sister of Cluentius the elder, and an aunt

1Lambinus substituted Avitus for Habitus, and the form thus
introduced was adopted by all editors, till Classen, following
Niebuhr (Rha. Mus. i. 3, p. 223), restored the reading of the
MSS. Avitus is another name altogether (Tac. Ann. xiii. 54).
There was a L. Cluentius who opposed Sulla in the S. of Italy
during the Social War: cp. Verg. Aen. v, 122, Cloanthus—venus
unde tibi Romame Cluenti, where the poet's intention is to glorify
the yens Cluentia by tracing its origin to one of the companions
of Aeneas.
