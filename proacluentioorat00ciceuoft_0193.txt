ib. ii. ἓ 10, fore aliquando finem huius lucis: Cat. i. ἓ 15 : Sex.

Rosa· 1131111ῧο61 clausum 1111111 sanctum. This is the reading

which seems, on the whole, to be best supported by evidence
and probability. Some edd. bracket clausum nihil, following
the first hand in s.; others retain the words and repeat ei
before sanctum. The confusion arises from the same cause as

has been noted on ξ 25, numquam 86 iudiciis.

custodiae. This unusual plural is found in s'r. So
often φυλακαί for φυλακή.

ξ 32. 611111 essem 111 Asia. This was on the occasion of
Cicero's temporary retirement from the bar (11.0. 79) with the
view of recruiting his health. See Brutus, ξ 313, and Strachan-
Davidson’s Cicero, p. 20.

heredibus [secundis], ⁶ heirs in default‚' to whom the
property would revert in case of failure of issue. Cp. Hor.
Sat. ii. 5, 48. Secundis is not found in s'r, and it is difficult
to decide whether it really belongs to the text, cp. ludis
[publicis], ξ 27 : Classen and Ramsay accept it, while it is re-
jected by Baiter, Miiller, and Faussett. The word occurs in
Quint. viii. 4, 11 , but not as an actual quotation from this
passage.

b tpan'mm abegisset, ‘ had drugged herself to procure
a or lon.

rei capitalis, lit. ‘ on a charge involving her caput ’ (ἓ 20).
For the genitive of the charge cp. ἓ 97.

heredem familiae, ‘ the heir of a house) To a Roman
mind this would present itself as a very special enormity:
the formalities by which the practice of adoption was regu-
lated attest the importance attached to having some one to
take the succession and carry on the family sacra.

111 eadem iniuria, lit. ‘in the case of the same crime.’
For this use of in cp. in eius modi iniuriis, ἓ 13, in tantis
iniuriis, ἓ 14, where see notes.

si quidem, ‘ inasmuch as‚' giving the basis for a conclusion
already stated. This use, common in later Latin (see on
Quint. X. 7, 2) is frequently found in Cicero, and it should be
noted that si quidem always follows what· is practically an
apodosis: Brut. ἕ 39, pro Mur. §24‚ de Amicit. ξ 89. It
is probable that the instance in Phil. ii. ἓ 31, considered
doubtful by some editors, is to be explained in the same way.

mortem atque cruciatum. This phrase is common
enough for a ‘death of agony,' e.9. Verr. v. ξ 138, mortem
cruciatumque. The phrase, ‘corporis mors’ has been sus-
pected, but as a critic in the New York Natio‘n -(26th Dec.
