148 PRO A. GLUENTIO.

would not be difficult to convert -plere into praestare, which
Ι have accordingly suggested as the true reading.

in eius modi causa, ‘ with so poor a case.’ Cp. in eius
modi iniuriis, ἓ 13: in minus firmis causis, below. .

XIX. collegi me. This hrase is exactly equivalent to the
colloquial ‘ Ι pulled myseliptogether': the orator recovered
his constantia or sels-possession. Cp. Eur. Herc. Main. 627,
σύ τ’, ὦ ’γύναι μοι, σύλλογον ψυχῆς λαβὲ Τρόμου τε παῦσαι.

‚ fortiter esse agendum, ‘ that I must put a bold face upon
it. · .

1111 aetati qua, etc. This sentence depends loosely on
constitui: ‘I bethought me that it is generally reckoned to
the credit of a young pleader, such as I then was,’ etc. In
B. 0. 74 Cicero was thirty-two. For the abstract illi aetati cp.
ξ 168 ut aetas illa fert, ‘as young men like him will do' : so
also ξ 13, above.

periculis : cp. patroni omne periculum, ἓ 49.

11011 dennssem. For the transition from the general to
the particular, cp. a nobis, ἓ 3.

Itaque feci : ‘ and so I did?

omnia remedia. ac perfugia causarum: ‘ every legal
shift and loophole.'

quod timide dicam, ‘though I say so with diffidence.’
Cicero’s usage would seem to show that dicam is future : pro
Plane. ἓ 24, timide dicam, sed tamen dicendum est: Phil. xii.
§24, timide hoc dicam: scio enim, etc.: pro Sulla, ἓ 80. So
paene dicam, ξ 193.

§ 52. quidquid for quidque is rare in Cicero, but common
in early Latin z Plaut. Prin. 881, si unum quidquid sinqillatim
et placide percontabere, Ter. Adelph. 590. Cp. Lucr. i. 289:
Cic. ad Fam. vi. 1. 1, Tusa iv, 44, v. 58. Madvig (on Fin.
v. 24) doubts if the use can be extended to other genders than
the neuter. The force of the indefinite relative may be
brought out by rendering ‘ As fast as I laid hold of any point,
no matter what.' -

apprehenderam. For the iterative use of the plpf. indic.,
followed by an imperfect (extorquebat, ‘he would wrest it
from me ‘) cp. Liv. xxi. 22, ut cuiusque sors exciderat,
alacer arma raptim capiebat: pro Sese. ξ 68, quisquis erat
· quocumque venerat damnabatur: Verr. i. ξ 19, ut quisque
me viderat narrabat. Similarly Sall. Jugy. L. ad fin„ si ab
pereequendo hostes deterrere nequiverant, disiectos circum-
veniebant. After the introductory sentence in the text, the
construction is quite naturally maintained in Si quaesiveram
