N OTES. 163

(Brut. ὅ 241) into a family belonging to the Gens Aelia,
Staienus took the coyuome‘n Paetus, and called himself O.
Aelius Paetus Staienus. Such surnames were originally based,

cp. Balbus (‘ stammerer '), Naso (‘ big-nose '), and many others.

ex imaginibus Aeliorum ε tr. ‘from the illustrious house
of the Aelii.' The Ius Imayiuum was the right possessed by
families whose ancestors had held curule office at Rome to
keep waxen images of those ancestors in the atrium of their
houses: those images (busts, masks) were, as is well known,
a conspicuous feature in funeral processions. For the ques-
tion whether the stemma, or ‘family tree' consisted of lines
drawn from one imayo to another, or was a separate
genealogical chart, see note in Transl., pp. 134-5.

si se Ligurem fecisset. Cicero says that if Staienus had
taken the coynomen Ligur, instead of Paetus, those who knew
his character would have mistaken his nationality: he would
have been taken, in fact, as belonging to the barbarous tribe
of Ligurians. Cp. pro Sest. ξ 69, of Sextus Aelius Ligus,
qui coynomen sibi ex Aeliorum imayiuibus adripuit, quo mayis
‘nacionis eius esse quam yeneris videretur.

nationis generis cognomine. People would have
thought that Staienus ‘was using a racial rather than a
family surname.'—The reading nationis ma9is suae quam
(Ramsay) has much to recommend it: tr. ‘a race that was
his,' and cp. Prop. ii. 9. 30, aut mea si navis staret in oceano,
‘ ship of mine.’ Suae does not occur in ST, and this may point
to a transposition variant, the true reading being nationis
suae mayis quam.

planus: πλάνος. Cp. Hor. Ep. i. 17. 59, attollere fracto
crure planum.

Staienus had the money stowed away, he pretended that
Oppianicus had cheated him. Similarly below qui esset
factus condivisset.- the man was an accomplished liar him-

self, but he roundly asserted (pulchre adseverat) that the
swindler was Oppianicus.

⁷ [queritur se ab Oppianico destitutum} These words,
though found in all MSS. and edd. after simulatosque vultus, have
been excluded from the text. They have all the appearance of
“index words,” like A yitur causa, ἓ 58, § 173. The sentence
reads better without them, and they are in their proper place,
