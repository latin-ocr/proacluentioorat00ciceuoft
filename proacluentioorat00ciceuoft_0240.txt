indignity of being forced to take the oath by which the
demagogue Saturninus, who was countenanced by Marius,
sought to secure the ratification of an agrarian law which he
had proposed to the senate (Β. c. 100).

nedum t in Cicero only, as here, after negative sentences.
So once in Terence, H eaut. 454, Satrapa numquam sufferre eius
sumptus queat, ‘nedum tu possis.

his moribus, ‘with the existing state of society.' Cp.
Quinct. ἐξ 59, 93: ad. Q.F'. i. l, 3, 11.

ac sine: for the emphatic repetition of the pmposition,
see on ἓ 3 adfin.

ς 96. fflud iudicium, ‘the trial of J umus

non fuit.. ,non fuit. An instance of E'paualepsis (ξ 42);

ΞΡ.. Cpr} Mil. §5 211). Non fuit ea causa, iudices, profecto, non

non modus ullus: cp. nou mulieris modus, ἓ 191.

mos consuetudoque, ‘ traditional usage.' For the double
expression see on ξ 13.

vis illa, fuit. For the attraction see on haee, ἓ 34.

Verr. i. ξ 157. Falcula may have been the only juror intro-

the singular is possibly generic, as Flaec. ἓ 18, non iam est
