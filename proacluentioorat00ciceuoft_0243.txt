Ν OTES. 183

fi 99. Quid, quod, elliptical for Quid de eo dicam quod ?

Non dico. ‘Omission’ (praeteritio, occultatio) is a well-
known figure in rhetoric, when the speaker contrives to say
exactly what he professes to leave unsaid: cp. ἓ 188. Ad
Herenn. iv. 37, cum dicimus nos praeterire auc uon scire aut
nolle dicere id quod nuuc maxime dicimus.

ld quod 110εο10 an dici oporteat, etc„ ‘ though I almost
think I should say it.' The affirmative force of this and other
similar phrases begins to be noticed first in Cicero ε 111 earlier
Latin they are still dubitative.

Μ. Aemflio: the dative is quite usual with Zeyatus. The
person referred to is M. Aemilius Mamercus Lepidus, consul
Rc. 77, and proconsul in Italy in the year following, with
Staienus as his quaestor. Many editors (against all the Mss.)
read Mam. Aemilio, on the ground that Cicero would have
been care-ful to discriminate between this person and the M.
Aemilius Lepidus who in Rc. 77, the year after his consulship,
headed an insurrection against the senatorial government as
restored by Sulla.

praefecti, sc. socium, Roman officers commanding the
contingents of the allies.

conflatam. See on ἓ 18.

nomine, ‘ on account of,’ ‘on the head of,' originally a
book-keeping term. See on suo nomine, ξ 88, and cp. ἐξ 115,
120. For the action raised by Safinius Atella, see ξ 68.

§ 100. ino iudicio. The tendency to omit iu with the
ablative of place, where an adJ'ective or even a pronoun occurs
along with it (cp. uno iudicio, ξ 103) becomes more marked in
Livy and in later Latin, though it is never infrequent with
such words as totus, cunctus, omui-s and medius. Where there
is no attribute the ablative without iu occurs only in proper
names and such phraseological expressions as terra, mari,
dextra, loca—In the text the occurrence of iu Staienum
immediately afterwards is enough to account for Cicero’s
pJgf-ereneegor the ablativp withgut iu: gontragtssg 103 iu illo
i icio iuvi iosissimum: a so qui us m iu icus, .

P. Cominius is thus referred to in Brutus, §271‚ P.
Cominium Spoletinum, quo accusante defendi Ο. Cornelium.

Asconius mentions his speech for the prosecution as well
worth reading, propter semet ipsam.

diser-tia ‘elever speakers.’ For the difference between
disertus and eloquens, cp. Or. ἓ 18, where Cicero quotes

Antonius, disertos ait se vidisse multos, eloquentem omniuo
nemiuem: de Or. i., ἓ 94. Cp. ἓ 156.
