consulted at all in the matter, or else disowned the pro·
coeding, nor was there any entry in his books regarding it3
and as the newly-appointed jurors seem all to have voted
against Oppianicus, it was held probable that they as well as
J unius had been bribed by his accuser. In his impeachment
of Verres (ii. 1, ἓ 158) Cicero directly accuses him of having
been in league with J unius, and says that, fearing to suffer
his fate, he afterwards falsified his official lists. Here he
seems only to insinuate that the fact that no note of the
subsortitio could be found in his books, was not to be
wondered at considering the kind of man he was. ''

taken place, he goes on to say, related not to the ‘merits'
