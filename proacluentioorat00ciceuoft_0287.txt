N OTES. 227

peculatus, sc. quaestio : the court which deals with the
embezzlement of public moneys. Orchivius has been already
mentioned in ἓ 94, where the case of Faustus Sulla (de pecuniis
residuis) must be regarded as having come under a special
department of peculatus, i.e. that which dealt with the mis-
appropriation of public moneys by state officers to whom
they had been entrusted for public purposes. For the whole
subject of Peculatus, see Appendix B in Heitland's Pro 0.
Rabirio, pp. 88-93.

mea de pecuniis repetundis. Cicero was praetor 111 the
year nc. 66. For pecuniae repetundae see on ἓ 104.

de ambitu, as ἓ 98, where see notes. Mr. Faussett
defends ambitus, the reading of s'r: but Miiller seems right
in saying that we never find such a construction as sceleris
causam dicere: capitis causam dicere is different (cp. Mil. §59,
where editors prefer quaestio de incestu to quaestio incesti).
There is an exact parallel to the order of words in Sest. ἓ 18,
ne de ambitu causam diceret. The divergence between ambitus
and de ambitu may point to a gloss t apud quem nunc causa
dicitur would be enough to enable Cicero's hearers to identify
the quaestio. Or again, the true reading may be Zeqe ambitus:
cp. ἓ 156, ea leye causa dicitur.

reliquae quaestionem for example, the quaestio under
the Lex Cornelia de maiestate (ἓ 97), the quaestio which dealt
with matters of breach of trust, inheritance, and forgery,
under the Lex Cornelia de falsis: also the quaestio de vi,

established by a Lex Plautia (Sall. Cat. 31).

, imperio et praescripto. For the substantival use of the
participle cp. de Or. ii. ἓ 302, ex oratoris dicto aliquo aut
responso aut rogato: Verr. v. ξ 139, satis est factum promisso
‘nostro ac recepto.

§ 148. clames te... non teneri. The Crimen Repetundarum
(pecuniarum) was originally a charge of extortion, with a

claim for restitution in name of dam-ages, preferred against a ,

provincial governor; and it was afterwards extended to all
acts of malversation. It also appears to have been made to
include the taking of a bribe by a iudex (pecunia ob rem
iudicandam capta) ; at least such a clause appears in the Lex
Iulia Repetundarum (13.0. 59) which probably followed the
Lex Cornelia, and also the still earlier Lex Servilia, at least
to the extent of embodying the provisions which enjoined
proceedings against those into whose hands the misappro-
priated money had passed, quo ea pecunia pervenerit <pro
Bab. Post. ch. iv.) See the note by Dr. Reid on ἓ 104 above:
