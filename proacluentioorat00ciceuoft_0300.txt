240 PRO Α. CLUENTIO.

quae quia vestrae quaestionis erant. It is not till we
get to ch. lx. that Cicero begins to deal directly with the
crimina veneni. What follows here concerns certain charges

by which the prosecution had sought to take away the defen-
dant's character.

nihil praeter invidiam, i.e. the odium which the other
side knew would attach to Cluentius on the ground of his
connection with the trial of Oppianicus, though, as Cicero
puts it, they must have despaired of getting a conviction
according to the letter of the statute. See Introd. p. xxxiii.

LIX. ἓ 161.. Decidio Samniti, ‘ Decidius the Samnite!
The resemblance in the name has induced some authorities to
identify this person with Decius Samnis, an individual other·

wise unknown, on whose behalf Caesar seems to have spoken

in cambus, ‘on the upland pastures.' Gallis is defined
by Isidor. Oria. xv. 16. 20, as iter pecudum inter montes
auqusCum et tritum, α callo pecudum tritum. Cp. pro Sese. ξ 12,
Italiae calles et pastorum stabula ; Livy, xxii. 14. 8, nos hic
pecorum modo per aestivos saltus deviasque calles exercitum
ducimus. The MSS. have iu collibus, which would simply
mean ‘ on the hill-side ' 3 but the incident in the text probably
occurred on the highland pastures to which it was customary
to send cattle during the heat of summer. Capes (on Livy
1. c.) notes that the early agrarian laws recognized this custom
by leaving a wide margin along the highways for the transit
and pasturage of the cattle (cp. the modern trallure) ; and in
our text the words ul solet indicate the frequency of the
encounters between drovers to which this arrangement would

ς 162. heres hic alienior institutus est: ‘the defendant,
an utter stranger, was made his heir-at-law.' Op. §135‚
coheredes homines alienissimos. Alienior is an instance of the
comparative used absolutely, indicating the presence of the
quality in a considerable or too high a degree: so liberius
vivere, asperius loqui. Cp. iucundior, §1102 crudior, § 168:
occultiora, ξ 194.
