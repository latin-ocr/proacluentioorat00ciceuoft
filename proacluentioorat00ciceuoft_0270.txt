210 PRO A. CLUENTIO.

As to the reading, esse might be dropped altogether ι or we
may accept, as has been done in the text, the easy emendation
sese. I have also thought of inserting ec and reading aliquid
esse et comperisse, i.e. let the censors allege that there is

flagitium rei militaris, ‘a gross breach of military
discipline‚' such as cowardice‚ loss of standards in action, or
mutiny. The phrase :flayicinm in ‘re militari admissam: for
