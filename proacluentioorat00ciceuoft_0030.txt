xxvi PRO A. CLUENTIO.

bribery (cp. nummarii pauci, ἓ 75), and in order to
convert a possible minority of 15 into a majority
Cluentius had to over-bribe at least some of those who
had already pledged themselves to Oppianicus, αφ,
Bulbus, Gutta, and Staienus himself. The 'irregular
subsortitio of Falcula (ἓ 103) secured for Cluentius one
vote which may have been doubtful before3 and—in
order, possibly, to divert suspicion—it was arranged
that Staienus, whose vote was no longer indispensable,
should stay away. Quinctius, however, insisted on
his being brought back into court, and the result was
a verdict of Guilcys by 17 votes (instead of 16) against 15.

The account of the interview Oppianicus had with
Staienus after his conviction (ἓ 78), and a reference to
certain disclosures which the condemned man is alleged
to have made,l render it probable that, without trying to
save his own character, Oppianicus sought to show that
Cluentius was fully as guilty as himself. Staienus had
tricked him, but he would take care that the truth should
be known. The closeness of the division may have
resulted from the eager efforts made 011 both sides.
Cluentius won—by a single vote, that of Staienus: Staieni
sententia condemnatum videbant, ἓ 78.

The issue was certainly by no means so conclusive as it
had been in the previous cases of Scamander and Fabricius.
When Cicero appeared for the former, eight years before,
he had taken, as we have already seen, an entirely different
view of the case. From more than one passage in his
speeches, statements can be cited which are quite irre-
concilable with his present position: αφ 2 Verr. ii., ἐξ
78-9, where he illustrates the conduct charged against
Verres by the double treachery of Staienus (cp. i., ἓ 39) ;
1 Verr. ἓ 29, where he refers to the corruption of the
“Iunianum consilium'’ : Π). ἐξ 38, 39, where, in citing
