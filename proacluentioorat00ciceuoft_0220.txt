tainly if Safinius had lost, and the sale had been upheld, there
would have been no point in giving him back what really
belonged to the property that had passed from him.

’ recepisset. The more usual phrase is causam suscipere,
ἐξ 39, 49, 136. Recipere implies more than suscipere, in respect
that the person who ‘ undertakes ' makes himself responsible
for the issue. Op. de Or. ii. ἓ 101, in quo est illa quidem
mayna offensio vel neqleyentiae susceptis rebus vel perfidiae
receptis.

11011 1110ᾱο for non modo non: see on ἓ 9.

suppressiones iudiciales, ‘ embezzlement in courts of
justice.

iugulatum, lit. ‘with his throat cut.’ We might say
that the two previous verdicts had ‘ left him without a leg to
stand on.' This figurative use is very common in Cicero:
cp. Quinct. §442 ad Act. i. 16, 2, cum illum plumbeo 9ladio
inquloetum iri tamen diceret: ad Herem. iv. 51, uno iudicio
simul multos iuquzaveritis.

hominem. See on ξ 49 ; so again ξ 72.

5 69. possit is the ‘ vivid' present, giving the very words
of Staienus. An English equivalent would be: No one, he
said, could do the business “ except myself.”

gravari, ‘ to hang back,' or ‘ back down.' It was to be ’
110 light task for him: he undertook it with reluctance‚
‘ made difficulties ' about it. Subsequently his scruples were
overcome (exoratus). A pleonasm, very characteristic of
Cicero, may be remarked in yravari quod ...dicebam the
verb of saying is, in fact, often itself put in the subjunctive.

Roby, ἓ 1746.

invidiam atque offensionem. This is one of Cicero's
double phraseS‚ ‘ unpopularity and displeasure,' i.e. popular
displeasure: cp. invidiam infamiamque, ξ 79, and see on
manibus ec 9remio, ἓ 13. So invidiam atque offensionem susci-
pere, Verr. ii. ἓ 137. For another meaning oi offensio, see on

ἓ 10.

confici, ‘ made up,’ ‘ got together? as at ἕ 74: tr. ‘he
came down to a negotiable figure.'

homo impurissimus, ‘ the dirty scoundrel.’

ς ’10. cum animis vestris recordari, ‘ to recall to mind.’
The explanation of the preposition seems to be that the mind
is considered as assisting the effort of recollection ε the mind
and its owner are, in fact, in partnership over the effort of
’ recollection, Nagelsbachfl, §90‚ 2, p. 360. So Hom. od. xv.
202, Ὡς φάτο· Νεστορίδης δ’ ἄρ’ ἑῷ συμφράσσατο θυμῷε Plaut.
