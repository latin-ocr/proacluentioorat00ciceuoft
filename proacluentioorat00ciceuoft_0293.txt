N OTE'S. 233

sino cupiditate, ‘free from the spirit of partizanship’ or
‘ambition' : see on ἓ 66. Contrast qui sese volunt posse omnia
in what follows. This explanation seems preferable to Mr.
Faussett’s ‘without greed': he takes the phrase as equi-
valent to inteyritate above.

equites ordini senatorio, etc. The union of the equites
and the senate in a ‘ moderate ' party was subsequently
Cicero's own declared ideal z he thought that it had been per-
manently realized in his consulship. Cp. in Pis. ἓ 7, ita est a
me consulatue peractus ut multitudinem cum principibus
equestrem ordinem cum senatu coniunxerim: ad Att. i. 17. 10,
tueor ut possum illam a me conylutinatam concordiam. See
Strachan Davidson's Cicero, pp. 164-5.

sed 11 qui, etc. The majority, Cicero says, fear nothing
for themselves from the statute under discussion, and they see
no reason why knights of good character should fear anything
either: but the selfish minority (ii qui 3838 volunt posse omnia)
think to intimidate the knights if they can succeed in actually
bringing them within the clutches of the law (z‘n huiusce leqis
periculum concludatur). There may be a reference here to the
senatorial leaders of the popular party, of whom the most
ppwgrful was Julius Caesar (then thirty-five years of age) and

. rassus.

sese volunt posse omnia. After verbs of wishing, a pro-
nominal accusative (with the infinitive) is often employed
instead of the simple infinitive‚ the object of the will and
desire being conceived as a distinct thing in itself and thus
emphatically expressed. This usage is most common with a
passive infinitive or with esse: de Le99. i. §4‚ e90 me cupio

non mendacem putari3 ad Fam. i. ἓ 9. 18, qualem me et 8338
et numerari volo.

that the efi‘gct of eitending the operatign oi⁷⁰tl1e Cornelign
Law from the senators to members of other classes who might
have been guilty of the offence against which it was directed
(as would be done if Cluentius were held liable to its provi-
sions) would be to place the equites on the same level as the
members of the senate. But as the former now (B.c. 66)
shared with the latter and a third class (the tribuni aerarii)
the privilege of serving as jurors‚ they should surely, in
equity, have been made to accept the responsibilities attend-
ant on that privilege. No statute making them amenable had
been passed (ch. liii. ad init. )‚ and Cicero protests against the
thing being done, as it were, by a side wind.
