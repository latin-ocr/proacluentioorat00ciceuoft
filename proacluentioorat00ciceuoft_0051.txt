true text could undoubtedly be better established from
s and Τ than from ω, the proportion of what are probably
right readings being somewhat as 156 to 97. This is
quite consistent with the theory that s'r are highly cor-
rected by the infiltration of superior readings. It is
interesting to recall-the probability that many of these
may have been derived from MSS. which no longer exist,
(3.9. the codices which appear in the catalogues of Lorsch
(saec. ix.) and Cluny (saec. xii.).

The following are the principal passages where the
reading of s'r is undoubtedly to be followed (without the
support of Ρ, which is wanting), as against the vulgate ε
