212 PRO A. CLUENTIO.

Aut quam condicionem. This sentence may be made
to furnish a useful lesson in textual criticism. The reading
adopted 1s that of the Turiu palimpsest. On the other hand,
we have in s'r, affici oportere convenire ut ad quam..
constitua-33 from which might easily result a text constituted
as follows· aut statuis qui in eadem culpa sit non eadem poena
adfici oportere, et convenire ut quam condicionem.. ‚eandem tu
in pace constituas. We might argue that the confusion arose
when some scribe construed oportere et convenire together
(along with adfici), then dropped oportere as superfluous, and
erected what follows into an independent question. But in
view of the great age of the Turin palimpsest (though its
authority cannot always be followed), it seems more
probable that, in the first place, oportere slipped into the
text as a gloss on convenire, to which an ut was gratuitously
added (with the consequential change of constituas for con-
stitues), and aut altered into ad.

While the text runs smoothly enough, in one continuous
question, on the alternative reading suggested (except for
aut statuis.. ‚convenire ut. constituas), the analogy of Hoc
tu idem facies· censor and tu non animadvertes makes strongly
in favour of the future 1n an independent question eandem tu
in pace constitues.

factum esse oportuit. This usage (sometimes without
esse, as accusatum oportuit, §90) seems to have belonged to
familiar style, and to have been common in early Latin.
Instances in Terence are Adelph. 214, morem yestum oportuit ;
Heaut. 536, haee facta ab illo oportebat; Andr. 239, nonne
prius communicatum oportuit. So with decuit, debueram, etc.

in multorum peccato, ‘ where many are guilty.' See on
in eadem iniuria, ἓ 32.

ad ignominiam [et turpitudinem] So Verr. i. ξ 23, per
iqnominiam turpitudinemque. For our text the authority of
the Turin palimpsest (which omits et turpitudinem) would be
sufficient to justify the deletion of et turpitudinem as a gloss
(cp. α tribuno seditioso below), were it not that the reading
it gives is et iynominiam for ad iqnominiam. Possibly the
true reading may be ad turpitudinem et iynominiam: cp.
Verr. i.‚ ξ 49. Merguet strangely quotes paucos ex multis ad
iq1207ninidm [et turpitudinem] sortiere from the beginning of
the section.

XLVII. § 130. ventum quendam popularem, ‘the breeze,
as it were, of popular favour' : cp. on §77. The action of
the censors was, in fact, a ‘bid' (quaesitum, cp. §13l) for
popular applause.
