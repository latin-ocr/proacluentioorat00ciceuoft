The Lex Cornelia de Sicariis et Veneficis dealt with charges of
assassination and poisoning, and also with the crime of pro-
curing a judicial conviction by unjust means. The peculiarity
of the statute was that, while any one could be brought to
trial under the former heads, those only who had held high
state office, or who were members of the senate (i.e. all mem-
bers of the senate, official and unofficial)‚ were liable to
impeachment under the latter. Accordingly Cicero contends
that, if he were allowed to rest the defenee on the letter of the
law, Cluentius, as a Roman eques, could plead that it did not
apply to him. Cp. Introduction, p. xxxiii.

iudicem quaestionis. This was the ‘presiding judge‚'
Q. Voconius Naso. The Quaestio de Sicariis et Veneficis had,
as we have seen (ἓ 147), two other iudices quaestionis, Plae-
torius and Flaminius, besides its own praetor. The iudex
quaestionis in this court was “ a criminal judge of somewhat
lower rank than the praetor, holding an office that belonged
to the regular circle of the magistracies. Brut. ἓ 264,

on ἓ l181i11nitum est: “there is no limitation of persons.'’ In
contrast with this are the terms of the Sixth Chapter of the law,
which is no longer general, but is applicable only to certain
classes of offenders : deque eius capite, etc.

legionibus, dative of possession. There were four first
legions, five second, and four third. The four first were
those assigned in early times to the consuls: their twenty-four
tribunes ranked among the maai-stratus, as being appointed,
not by nomination of the consuls but by popular election from
the senatorial or equestrian orders.
