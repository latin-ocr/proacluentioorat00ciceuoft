omnes cives legibus teneri omnibus: ‘ that every law is
binding on every citizen.' This appears to be a slight ex-
aggeration of the real argument of his opponent. Accius had
contended that the same laws shonld be binding on all (who
came within the sphere of their operation): ξ 150, iniquum
tibi videtur, Acci, esse uon isdem Zeyibus omues teneri. But this
hardly amounts to saying that every law is binding on every
citizen. In the case before us, knights as well as senators,
Accius urged, ought to be held amenable ; for both orders
now shared the administration of the jury courts. His case
was that a true interpretation of the lex Cornelia was enough
to bring Cluentius under its provisions: see on ξ 160. Cp.

fraude, dudi some others. In post-Ciceronian Latin this usage
