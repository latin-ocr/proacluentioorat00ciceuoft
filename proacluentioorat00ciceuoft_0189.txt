N OTES. 129

in causa. iudicioque, ‘ on the occasion of his trial.'

potuisse arbitretur. So only one ms. ; all others potuisse
arbitraretur, which is inappropriate after the preceding Quis
est, and may probably have resulted from the misinterpreta-
tion of a contraction. There is an exact parallel at ἓ 96, 10,
and also in Mil. §78, Quis iyitur eet qui arbitretur, where
all codd. give arbitraretur.

IX. Atque. I have ventured to suggest Atqui instead of
Atque, as introducing a distinct stage in the development of
the argument.

domo = οἰκόθεν, he would have to ‘ draw upon his home
resources,' πλε. he did not need to go outside for what he
wanted. The expression is proverbial: Plaut. Amph. 637,
Bacch. 648: domo petes, ad Fam. vii. 25. Cp. Phil. ii. §26‚
ab alienis potius consilium peterent quam a suis? et foris potius
quam domo ?—D0m0 has been suspected by some critics‚ and
is icertainly a little awkward after domum (for which two
Palatine MSS. give dexteram) in the preceding sentence. It is
well known that domo and modo are frequently confounded
in MSSz hoc modo is therefore an easy emendation. Orelli
proposed quoquo modo. There is a similar interchange of
consonante between monitae and dominante (for domitae ἲ),
ἓ 67 : cp. molestia ΒΤ in ξ 10, where other MSS. have dolore.

ad = adversus.

Teanum Apulum, so called to distinguish it from Teanum
