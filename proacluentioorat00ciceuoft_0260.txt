qui a me honoris causa nominatur, ‘ whose name Ι
mention with much respect‚' a conventional phrase of fre-
quent occurrence in Cicero's speeches‚ with much the same
effect as “my honourable friend '' in modern parliamentary

debates. An indirect and almost apologetic method of allusion ·

was adopted in making reference to living persons of distinc-
tion, in order to preclude the idea. that they were being in-

vidiously dragged into the discussion of the subject in hand ; ·

Rosc. Am. ἓ 47, homines notos sumere odiosum est, cum et illud
incertum sit, velintne ii sese nominari. Op. appellare, ἓ 18.
The opposite is contumeliae causa nominare, Verr. Act. i. ἓ 18.
Similarly Rosc. Am. ἓξ 6, 15, 27; Phil. ii. ξ 30; and especially
Q. Rosc. Com. ἕ 18, Nonne quoties cumque in causa in nomen
huius incidisti toties hanc et virum bonum esse dixisti et honoris
causa appellasti? quod nemo nisi aut lionestiesimo aut amicissimo
facere consuevit.

in amicorum periculis, ‘when friends of his are im-
perilled by actions-at-laW.' sine huius periculo, ‘without
imperilling my client's cause.'

fides huius defensionis, ξ 10. Mr. Faussett takes huius
as masculine, governed by defensionis ; ‘ loyalty in the defence
of my client.' But it may go with the noun. Translate in
either case, ‘ What is in honour due to the defendant?

ἓ 119. istam ipsam causam might mean ‘ that very trial,’
i.e. their conduct on the bench at the trial before J unius: cp.
ξ 127, haec quidem quae cle iudicio corrupto sub-scripserunt.
But istam seems rather to require some such rendering as
‘the very reason which you state‚’ or ‘assigning the facts
alleged as their reason.'

illud commune, ‘ the general thesis ' (proponam) or
‘ proposition.' For the fact cp. de Rep. 4, 6, censoris iudicium
nihil fere damnato nisi ruborem adfert.

in re nota is to be taken, on the reading of the text,
closely with consumam, ‘over a fact that is notorious) This
is the usual construction in Cicero with consumere tempu-3,
operam, etc„ though the simple ablative is also found in
gerundial constructions (dicendo, etc). Mr. Faussett's refer-
ence to the use of the preposition in ξ 57 (cp. ἓξ 13, 32),
seems to postulate the alternative reading, neque in re nota
(‘ where the facts are notorious,') consumam tempus exemplis.
Ponam, etc. Classen thought that the final s in exemplis
being mistaken for a c was the origin of causa (ST.) ε but on
the other hand it may be held that causa is one of the words
which, being written in contracted form, are specially liable
to drop out. See below, ἕ 120, ad fin. where causam is
