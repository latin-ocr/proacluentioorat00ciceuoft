xiv PRO A. C'L UENTIO.

motive for the crime for which Oppianicus had been
condemned eight years before (cp. p. xxi). This is the
⁵ probabile ex causa (ἓξ 43-45), to which Cicero appende a
narrative of the method by which Oppianicus (according
to his story) sought to carry out his evil design. He
addressed himself to a certain O. Fabricius, through whom
overtures were made to the slave of the physician who
happened at the time to be in attendance on Cluentius.
Poison was to be given the patient instead of medicine.
But the slave communicated the design to his master,
and a trap was set by which Scamander, a freedman

Diogenes, the slave in question, to whom he was in the
act of paying a sum of money to procure poisoning

for acquittal—Staienus, a needy aud disreputable senator ;
and it was to him accordingly that Oppianicus applied,
placing a large sum of money in his hands to bribe
the bench and secure his acquittal. Cicero's account
of what happened at this trial must, like the Scamander
story, form the subject of a separate investigatiml, as
constituting one of the main difficulties of the narrative ε
meanwhile it may be stated here that Oppianicus was
found guilty, but only by a narrow majority (ἓ 76).
The defence of Oppianicus had been conducted by
the tribune, Quinctius, who now declared that Cluentius
had bribed the court. He put himself at the head
of a wider agitation, which aimed. at the suppression
of the senatorial juries and the restoration of its
privileges to the equestrian order. A series of pro-
ceedings was instituted which proved fatal to quite a
