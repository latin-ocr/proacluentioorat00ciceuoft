a transitory capitis deminutio, which does not even appear to
have deprived a magistrate of his office (Liv. xxiv. 18), and
certainly did not disqualify persons labouring under it for
obtaining a magistracy, for being appointed as iudices by the
praetor, or for serving in the Roman armies. Mam. Aemilius

This antithesis involves the distinction, such as it was, between
infamia and iynomi‘nia. Infamia followed conviction on a
charge attaching grave persona] discredit (turpe iudicium),
such as furtum, iniuria, dolus, or conviction in a iudicium
tutelae (de Or. i. ἓ 166), pro socio, or mandati. It was thus
attached necessarily and inevitably, but not always by express
declaration or deliverance, as a definite penalty for the com-
mission of certain offences, and it involved the loss of many
civil rights, e.9. the right of voting or holding public office.
Like the offence of belonging to a disgraceful profession,
such as that of a play-actor, misdemeanours of the kind
