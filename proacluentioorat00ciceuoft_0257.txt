on which he was convicted of malversation. But he seeks
to prove from analogous cases that if Scaevola had been
brought up subsequently on a charge founded on that assess-
ment he would in all likelihood have been acquitted ; and he
therefore contends that such assessments cannot be allowed
the force of precedents.

law‚’ πλε. in trying an aceused. Some editors have adopted
Pluygers’ emendation in cetero iudicio. Perhaps we may ex-
plain ‘all other trials,’ = ‘trials generally' (Rosa. §12), as
distinguished from the litis aestimatio which follows3 cp.
ceteri, ἓξ 28, 32 ad fin. Dr. Reid thinks that ceteris may be a
gloss. I should prefer to retain it (cp. neyleyentius attendunt
cetera below), and to read in ceteris, iudices. Cp. 589, 25.

5 116. In litibus aestimandis, etc. ln fixing the penalty,
the jury, according to Cicero’s argument, are disposed either to
leniency, in order to avoid the appearance of further hostility
towards one whom they have already turned into a personal
enemy or else to carelessness, because they imagine they are
now well through with the business of the court.

siquae in eum lis non admittunt, ‘ refuse to entertain

any demand for a capital assessment made against him,’ i.e. ,

any capital charge which it may be proposed to make an
element in the assessment. Dr. Reid says that lis capitis
does not seem to occur elsewhere 3 but is the genitive not to
be taken closely with the verb? Cp. capitis aestimaretur at
the end of this section. For illata cp. inferendis litibus, Bab.
Post. ἓ 9.—F0r non admittunt Dr. Postgate (see not. cr.) pro-
poses non remittunt, explaining that the jury is severe (not
lenient) because they wish to get their enemy away from Rome.
Taken by itself, non admittunt certainly does nothing to mini-
mize the importance of a severe litis aestimatio. But the fact
is mentioned as only one illustration of the comparative want
of diliyentim or conscientious attention.

Itaque et maiestatis, etc. This being so, Cicero continues,
even in cases where a graver charge (e. [J. maieslas) has been
admitted into the assessment (being a different charge from
that on which the defendant was originally brought to trial),
a court of justice often refuses to convict a man when sub-
' sequently brought to trial on this graver charge, thus plainly
showing that it does not regard such assessments as precedents.

quibus lites maiestatis essent aestimatae, lit. ‘ though
a penalty had been assessed against them for treason after
they had been convicted of malversation.' Owing to the
leniency, or carelessness (or both) generally shown by jurors
in the titis aestimatio, a court of justice, Cicero says, will
