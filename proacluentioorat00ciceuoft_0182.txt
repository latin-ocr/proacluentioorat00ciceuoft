122 PRO A. CLUENTIO.

17, 8 (as was natural, or usual, in a crisis): cp. xxvi. 8, 2.
An exact parallel to uc a viro nou libenter, sc. discedit, may be
found in Liv. xxi. 12, 4, condicionesque tristes ut ab irato
victore serebantur. ΟΡ. on 5 58.

victrix filiae non flbiffinis: These words have the ap·
pearauce of an adscript, inserted in the margin by some
moralist who wished to give point to exsultare, triumphare,
and afterwards connected with what follows by Itaque.
Omitting itaque, some editors (Baiter) have put a full stop
at coepit, and have construed the words victrix libidinis
with ‘noluit in what follows. In the text it has been con-
sidered safest to follow the tradition of the maJ‘ority of MSS.
(and so, virtually, Classen and Ramsay). Dr. Reid thinks

serva: cp. in Verr. ii. 4, 112, and ii. l, 58. Assuming that
the words are genuine, I wouldsuggest that, in what follows,
Cicero may have written Ita cum diutius 'nolit iubet. Ita
cum may have resulted (through Ita quod) in Itaque (5 28, 263
5 23, 93 5 98, 12) z for nolit cp. 5 149, 8.

laetitia gaudio. The former is the stronger word.
In his note on Mil. 521, Mr. Clark refers to Tusc. iv, 13,
where Cicero “ defines laetitia as connoting extravagant joy,
while qaudium is used of a rational and tranquil emotion.
Hence ib. 5 66, {laudere decet laetari non decec.'’ ·

lectum illum genialem, not the cubile of 5 15, but the
bed which stood in the atrium of a Roman house, not for
actual use, but as a symbol of the married state. ΟΡ. Hor.
Ep. i. 1, 85, lectus yenialis iu aula est.

nullis auspicibus, ‘ with no auspicious rites,' lit. ‘no
soothsayers.’ For ‘nullus c. abl. = ‘without ' cp. nullo teste,
nullo iudice, 5 38. The conservatism of the Romans is nowhere
more conspicuous than in their retention of such religious
formalities: Cic. de Div. 5 28, nuptiarum auspices re
omissa nomeu tantum teuent. ΟΡ. JUV. Sat. X. 336, veniet cum
siquatoribus auspex.

nums auctoribus, ‘ with no one to sanction the alliance,'
no consenting witnesses. Sassia had nobody to ‘ give her

away.' ΟΡ. Ter. Adelph. 671.

VI. 5 16. praeter hanc unam, probably an instance of
brachylogy :praeter scelus huius unius mulieris. Commenta-
tors have failed to note, however, the remarkable variant of
ST, praeter hauc causam unam. Unless the final c in hane
can be taken as explaining the intrusion of causam (cp. the
variants exemplis and exempli causa, 5 119), it is tempting to
