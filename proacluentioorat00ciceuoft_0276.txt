cum censor esset. Scipio the younger was censor in Β. c.
142, along with L. Mummius, the conqueror of Corinth. The
story is told also in very similar language by Valerius
Maximus, iv. 1. (De Moderatione).

in equitum censu, ‘ at the review of the knights.' This
inspection of the equites equo publico took place in the forum,
and each knight as his name was called, according to his
tribe, walked past the censors‚ leading his horse. 1f the
censors had no fault to find, they ordered him to pass on
(traduc equum, Valer. Max. iv, 1, ξ 10): but anyone who was
considered unworthy could be struck off the list and deprived
of his horse (Livy, 39. 44) or ordered to sell it (Livy, 29. 37),
“ with the intention no doubt that the person thus degraded
should refund to the state the money which had been advanced
to him for its purchase '' (Dict. Ana).

verbis conceptis, ‘ in a set form of words, ‘ solemnly and
deliberately.' Long cites de Off iii. ἓ 108, εἰσίιι7 verbis con-
cipitur more nostro, ‘ according to our solemn formula.'

contra dicere, ie. to take up the roll of accuser: cp.
on ἓ 126, nihil se cestibus, etc.

contentae, i.e. it was enough for them : so ἓ 119.

ad ignominiam : see on ad perniciem, ξ 129.

Quod si hoc Habito facere licuisset. Cicero evidently
means us to understand—though he wishes to make as little of
the incident as possible—that no one moved the censors to
censure Cluentius, and that he had no opportunity of defending
himself τ see again note on nihil se testibus, etc., ἕ 126. Their
‘ animadversion' on the prosecutor in the Iudicium lunianum
followed consequentially, according to what is said here, on

their censure of the jurors.
The text is usually construed, ‘ But if it had been permitted

to Habitus to do this,' and on the explanation that facere hoc
is used in a vague sort of way for ‘to be treated like this’
(τοῦτο πάσχειν), the meaning extracted is, “ But if this treat-
ment had been accorded to Habitus‚'' ie. if he had had a fair-
minded censor like Africanus, and had not been censured
when there was no evidence against him. The words cannot
mean, ‘ if Habitus had had the same opportunity,' i. e. of .
defending himself ε Sacerdos had not needed to offer a defence.

Instead of founding on this vague use of facere (Lewis
and Short, ΒΝ. ii. Eu), Dr. Reid proposes to construe ‘if 'an
