N OTES. 259

non mulieris modum i.e. not by any moderatiori on her
part. Sassia was not the sort of person to know when she
had ‘gone far enough.’ For modus cp. on §962 Tac. Dial.
40, nullus maqistratuum modus.

t· falsae conscriptiones quaestionum: the forged deposi-
lons.

conscelerata: a very strong word. Op. nefarium et
consceleratum vultam, ἕ 29: consceleratae matris, ἓ 193.

comparatio: the ‘presentment' of the indictment. Tr.
‘It was she, in a word, who devised and set forth all the
materials of this elaborate prosecution.'

ς 192. accusatorem filio suo. The recurrence of this
phrase four times in close context suggested to Dr. Reid that
we ought certainly here to read, fili sui, —possibly also in
ἐξ 190, 191. There may be some point, however, in the

mater, emphatic by position, as ἓ 190. Tr. ‘A sight so

and his woeful unkempt appearance.' Cp. ξ 18, squalore
huius el sordibus laetatur.

Mulierem quandam Larino proficisci. This sentence is

and infinitive cf ‘indignant exclamation' : cp. the scene pre-
sented in indignation and scorn to the imagination of the
orator's hearers, V err. 5 ξ 100, Ο spectaculum miser-um! in
portu Syracusano de. classe populi Romani triumphum affere
piratam! (Roby, ξ 1358).

Α remark by the reviewer of my Translation in the Journal
of Education has suggested to me the emendation which I
have presumed to introduce into the text. Quandam, the
reviewer says, is “sufficient to show that we have here the
remarks of the onlookers reported obliquely.'' It is certainly
difficult to find a place for quandam in any such rendering aS,
“ The idea of a lady of Larinum setting out !'’ The clause be-
ginning atque illam must surely, as Madvig points out (Adv.
ii. 101), have subjoined some particular attribute of mulierem
Larino. Unless we can put a stop at Larino, and construe it
(without a verb) like Teano Apulo atque Luceria equites Rom-
anos videtis (cp. ἕ 36, Fuit Avillius quidam Larino), we may
