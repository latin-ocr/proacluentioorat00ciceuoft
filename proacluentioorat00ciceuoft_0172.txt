112 PRO Α. CLUENTIO.

the Turin palimpsest (P), against all the other MSS„ which
give omnem. Eorum omnium seems to resume de criminibus
more emphatically than omnem.

oratore, eounsel for' the defence‚ like defensor immedi-
ately below. In hearing charges directly preferred (crimina),
the jury looks to the defendant’s advocate for a complete
and comprehensive refutation, without any idea of ‘ making a
present to the accused of more in the direction of, or in
order to secure, acquittal' (ad salutem), i.e. of crediting him
with a greater degree of innocence than his counsel can show
warrant for. For this use of ad, cp. ἓ 129, ad perniciem
innocentis fidem et reliyionem pecunia commutare: Murena,
§29‚ dicendi consuetudo lonye et multum isti vestrae exercitationi
ad honorem antecellit: ibid. §38, hoc quanti putas esse ad
famam hominum ac voluntatem.

de invidia autem, etc. Whereas cases such as have just
been described turn upon questions of fact, and must be
decided by impartially weighing the evidence put forward,
the less tangible issues resulting from invidia ought to lead a
jury to consider more what an advocate ou9ht to say (quid
oporteat dici) than the pleadings which he actually advanees
(quid dicatur a nobis). The language of proof (sic ut vos

doceamus, below) is definite : the language of entreaty (sic ut .

oremus) leaves something to the hearer, who must supplement
the necessarily imperfect statement of an advocate by broader
and more general considerations. Op. the contrast between
nostri inyenii and vestri auxilii in ξ 4. Such considerations,
the speaker goes on to say, are of importanee as bearing on
the general interest (causa communis: cp. communibus invidiae
periculis, ἓ 8): the crimina, on the other hand, affect only
the defendant himself (Cluenti proprium periculum).

inter vos disceptare, ‘ to put the case to yourselves,’
‘ determine the question among yburselves.' On this reading
we must give disceptare the sense of debating or discussing
a doubtful point (dis-capio, lit. ‘ to seize hold of a1.(l separ-
ate ') : cp. Acad. ii. ξ 126, inter se disceptare ; Livy, xlv, 15, 5,
haec inter ipsos disceptata. So disceptatio veritatis, ἓ 81.
The word is, however, frequently used (absolutely) in the
sense of ‘ to arbitr-ate ’ (e.9. iudices, vobis disceptantibus, Verr.
iii. ξ 169), and this may have suggested the attractive variant
inter nos disceptare, a construction which is common enough
in later literature, if not found in Cicero himself.

a nobis, of counsel generally, including, of course, the
speaker z cp. the use of adhibemur, ἓξ 139, 144 ; debemus, ἕ 145.
There is a similar (particular) application of a general reflec-
tion in ἓ 51 2 solere laudi dari etiam si non defuissem.
