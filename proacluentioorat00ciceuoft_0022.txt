xviii PRO A. CLUENTIO.

that it was Diogenes who was to administer the drug,
and we must therefore suppose that he was either
handling it himself or allowing Scamander to handle
it at the precise moment when the friends intervened.
They certainly waited till they saw enough to convince
them that Scamander knew what he was paying his
money for. In connection with the poison brought by
Diogenes, the packet found on Scamander could point
only to one conclusion.

It may be an example of the way in which Cicero ,
sought, in defending Cluentius, to ‘throw dust in the
eyes of the jury,' that the ternis which he employs in
describing this incident vary in different places, At.
first he says-on the reading of ST in ξ 47 ¹—that it
was the money-bribe that was found on Scamander:
then immediately afterwards he speaks as if it were the
poison that Scamander was caught with,—cuiu3 in
manibus venenum deprehenderat ἓ 49, cp. venenum esse
deprehensum, and manifesta veneni deprehensione ἓ 50,
as well as ξ 20 eum manifesto venenum deprehendisset.
Lastly, in ἓ 53, he permits himself to use a phrase
implying that Scamander had both the money and the
poison about him when he was caught, eum veneno
pecuniaque deprehensum.

The defence which Cicero had put forward on the
occasion of Scamander’s trial was that it was medicine,
not poison, that Diogenes had brought to the rendezvous
(ξ 53). This could never have been suggested, with
any hope of acceptance, if there had been any allegation
that it was Scamander who had brought the poison: cp.
the use of quaesitum in ἓξ 55 and 62. Moreover, the
words venenum diebus paneis eomparatur (ἓ 47) must be
held as implying that it was Diogenes and his friends
who got ready the drug3 the action of eomparatur is
