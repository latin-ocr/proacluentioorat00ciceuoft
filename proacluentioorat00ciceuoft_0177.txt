 

N OTES. 1 1'7

Nam contra sensus ab sensibus ipse repuynat3 and ς 93, below,
non modo dicendi ab reo. Cp. the loose quotation in Quint.
iv. 5, ll, non pro Cluentio sed contra Cluentium.

quid res ipsa tulerit, ‘the actual facts of the case.' Cp.
ad Fam. i. 7, 6, quid res, quid causa, quid tempus serat tu
optime perspicies. Res ipsa: ‘ the bare facts ,²0pposed to quid
error adfinxerit, the ‘imported element' of misrepresenta-
tion, and quid invidia conflarit, the ‘forgeries of popular
prejudice)

ς 10. certissimis criminibus,‘we11-attested charges) For
this use of certus cp. index non incertus, ἕ 21. .

descenderit, sc. in forum. In the same way we speak
of members of Parliament ‘ going down to the House' The
subjunctive should be noted: it seems to present the fact
under the guise of a statement for which the speaker makes
himself responsible. Miiller would, however, read descendit,
and this may easily have been the original reading· in ξ 25,
15, and again in ἓ 96, 10, all MSS. wrongly give arbitraretur for
arbitretur, some scribe having imagined that he saw the mark
of a contractior) over the r. Cp. pro Sulla, ἓ 38, where the
codd. wrongly give responderit for respondit.

faciendum est ut: see on § 111.

fide atque officio defensioniS‚ ‘considerations of honour
and duty to the defendant? Fides defensionis = ‘ the honour
of an advocate, ’ as ἓ 118, fides huius defenwsionis

111 praesentia, ‘for the present‚’ ἓ 195. Lexicographers
now treat this phrase as an instance of in with the ablative.
cp. in praesenti. Cicero also has in praesens tempus.

si.. .satis facere non potuero, ‘if I am not able to
meet your views· . satis facerez‘ to do one’ s best for a person‚'
01· ‘ to fulfil one's obligations to him.’ The omission of sati-s
facere here (with ST) would give the sentence a more idiomatis
turn: cp. si oblivione non posset, ξ 18. Baiter therefore
brackets satis facere. But for instances of repetition of the
same word in different clauses, cp. arbitrabantur, ἓ 50;
sententia absolutus, ἓ 67 ; hoc, ἓ 30.

tamen multae mihi, etc. This courteous phrase has cer-
tainly an awkward look. Cicero seems to be telling the
younger Oppianicus that he must not mind if he stretches a
point in favour of his client.

illud. ‚dubitare. ,(116616. Τ116 constr. with quin (of
doubt as to whether a thing is as stated) occurs ξ 48, illud
quis est qui dubitet quin, etc. For the diffierence, see Dr.
Reid’s note on pro Sulla, ἓ 4; ancl cp. on Quintilian, x. 1,

§73
