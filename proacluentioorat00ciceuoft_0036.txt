xxxii PRO A. CLUENTIO.

Those who take the other view cite the division of the
case adopted in the exordium, and carefully maintained
throughout the speech: the prejudice arising out of the
bribery scandal (invidia) is separated from the charges
directly preferred against Cluentius (crimina), and Cicero
states (ξ 3) that, while the latter can be disproved‚ he
can only deal with the prejudice by throwing himself on
the protection of the court. In answer to this, it should
be noted that the orator does sometimes, as a matter of
fact, use the word crimen where we should have expected
him to use the more insidious term invidia: ey. ξ 8,
Αεῇᾳνθοῖίαν ad crimen, etc., and veteris istius criminis
diluendi potestas : ἓ 143, puryandi istius invidiosi criminis:
ξ 125, Cluentianae pecuniae crimen: cp. ἕ 97, At est hoc
illi crimen obiectum,

Again, it is urged that there are passages in the speech
in which it is distinctly stated that the question of
corrupt conduct at the iudicium Iunianum is not before
the court. In support of this view reference has been
made to the following passages z ἓ 160, Reliqua perpauca
sunt3 quae quia vestrae questionis erant idcirco illi statu-
erunt fin'qenda esse sibi et proferenda ne omnium turpissimi
reperirentur si in iudicium nihil praeter invidiam attulis-
sent; and, again, ἓ 164, Coynoscite nunc id . . . quod
vestri iudicii est . . . de criminibus veneni. But in using
such language as this, Cicero must not be taken as im-
plying that judicial corruption formed no part of the
present indictment against his client: what he asserts is

as it were, would seem to appear from ἓ 143, where, in the words,
Nimirum tibi istud lex ipsa renuntiavit, Cicero obviously wishes
to intimate his belief that his opponent was aware of the true
construction of the statute, in spite of the argument which he
had advanoed. Op. ξ 149, Nolo quemquam eorwm qui adsunt
existimare me quae de leye ab Accio dicta sunt, si reticuerim,
comprobare,
