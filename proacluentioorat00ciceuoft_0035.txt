accused of poisoning only, not of judicial murder} They
recognize in the elaborate refutation of the popular pre-
judice on the subject of the trial before Junius, Cicero’s
boasted achievement of having ‘thrown dust in the eyes
of the jury‚’ by defending his client from an accusation
that had never been made, in order that he may after-
wards be in a position to conciliate the sympathies of the
court by generously renouncing the technical plea on
which he might have declined to say a single word about
the circumstances which led to the conviction of Oppiani· ’
cus. According to this view, Cluentius was accused only
under the Fifth Chapter of the Lem Cornelia, which
related to poisoning, though Accius had done his best
to prejudice him in the eyes of the jury by dwelling on
his alleged conduct at the previous trial: Cicero, how-
ever, puts his case as though his client had actually
been impeached for “ judicial murder.''

In this edition, on the other hand, the view is main-
tained that Cluentius, though an eques, was accused, not
only of poisoning‚ but also under that section of the
Cornelian Law which related to conspiracy and judicial
murder, and which was technically applicable only to
senators. The prosecution appears to have. advanced the
argument that Cluentius was morally guilty under the
second head3 and also that the time had come when, in
view of the changed conditions of judicial administration,
the scope of the statute should be extended—by the
establishment‚ even retroactively, of such a p1ecedent as
this—to others who might be guilty of similar offences.2
