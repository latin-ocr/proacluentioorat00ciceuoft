INTROD UCTION. xxv

It is not improbable that Staienus was over-bribed by
Cluentius. The theory that he had an under-standing
with the prosecution would readily explain his absence
from court when the jury was about to retire in order
to consider their verdict. Without him the majority
would have been 16 to 15, and therefore he could have
been spared, especially considering that he was now
expected to turn his back on his previous performance
in acquitting Scamander3 but Quinctius, acting in the
interests of Oppianicus, and probably ignorant that
the other side had annexed him, insisted on having
Staienus brought back to court before the final vote
was taken.

The acquittal of Fidiculanius Falcula, on the other
hand (ἓ 91 and ξ 103), is a strong point in favour of
the defence which Cicero sets up in the speech before
us. It was charged against Falcula that he had been
given a seat on the jury at the last moment, and that
in empanelling him J unius 'had acted in collusion with
the praetor Verres. He was twice brought >to trial—
the second time on the direct charge of having taken
a bribe to vote against Oppianicus3 and on both
occasions he was acquitted. But Cicero cannot have
had much belief in his innocence, if we may judge
from the pro Caecina, ξ 29; Utrum yravius aliquid in
quemquam dici potest quam ad hominem condemnandum
quem nunqnam vidisset ‘neque audisset adductum esse
pretio? Cp. notes on ἓ 104.

Accepting Cicero’s narrative only so far as it helps
to point to a probable theory, we may suggest the
following as an approximately true version of what
actually happened. Oppianicus gave Staienus money
to make certain of sixteen votes, which, along with
his own, would ensure an acquittal. Some at least of
the thirty—two jurors were men of character, and above
