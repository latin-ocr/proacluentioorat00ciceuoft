why, it would have been beyond the power of bribery even
to baulk justice of her lawful prey ’—lit. ‘so that bribery
couldn't have torn him from u8.'' so Mr. Faussett: “ne eripi
quidem pecunia posset (nedum ut damnaretur pecunia esset
adhibenda). Bribery was powerless to avert a, conviction—
much less was it needed to procure one.'' The objection that
this statement would never have been made by a prosecutor
who is trying to saddle the defence with the bribery scandal,
and that it voids the (imaginary) argument of the defendant
when he follows with the admission that he had, unlike the
prosecutor, every motive to bribe, is apparent rather than real.
There is no ground for the inference that the defendant,
according to the prosecutor’s own showing, attempted an
impossibility. What the prosecutor says is that Oppianicus's
guilt was so manifest that bribery would have been of no
avail——as it seemed to him—even to avert a conviction. But
for all that the defenee, it is alleged, made the attempt.

The reviewer’s suggestion that pecunia is nominative cannot
stand ‘ so that a bribe couldn’t have been wrung out of me ’z
