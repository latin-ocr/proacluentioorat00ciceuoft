esse videatur. For this favourite ending see Quint. x, 2,

ξ 18, and Tac. Diat. 23, 3, with notes. Again at§ 118 ; esee

applicavit. Most MSS. have se applicavit, and editors
(except Classen and Ramsay) adhere to this tradition. But
this is a clear instance of the tendency on the part of a
scribe to repeat a word immediately before the word it
governs. For the position of 8e cp. § 46, adfln.

donis muneribusque. The simplest explanation of the
variants here (see crit. notes) seems to be that datis is an
adscript (cp. data, ἕ 87. 26) : in the recension embodied in εἰ·
donis was rejected, as well as the que after muneribus (which
would not be difficult with p following). Dona and munera
·are frequently conjoined: e.9. ἓ 190.

fautore cupidiore, ‘ a more interested supporter.’
For this sense of cupidus (‘biassed,' ‘ partial '), cp. pro ane.
ξ 8, cupidior quam sapientem iudicem esse aequum est. So
testis cupidus, de Or. ii. ξ 2⁶29, pro Font. ἓ 21 : cp. cupiditas,
for ‘partisan spirit‚' §152 Verr. A. P. §353 pro Plane.

postulabat. So ἓ 200, id quod vestra natura postulat.

ς 6¹7. unius Staieni sententia absolutus. Here the words
sententia absolutus have been suspected as an interpolation:
they are accordingly omitted or bracketed in many texts.
The case seems to be analogous to satisfacere in ἓ 10, where

see note: cp. arbitrabantur, ξ 50. The suppression of the
words would make the sentence more compact, but such re-

dundancy is just what is most characteristic of the orator.
It may reveal the absence of the pruning-hook, but that is no
sufficient reason for rejecting what is found in all MSS.

ne sua quidem sententia. For the discomfiture of
Fabricius, see ἓξ 58 and 59.

acrioribus remediis, ‘ more drastic measures‚' abl. of

salus (as in ἓ 3) is deliverance from perieulum, ἓ 18:
cp. saluti desperare, ἓ 68.

ad excogitandum acutissimo. For this use of ad, see
on ad fraudem callidi, ξ 183.

capit-i ac fortunis suis, ‘ his standing and estate) For
caput, see on ἓ 20. : for fortunae, see on §iffi ·

XXV. Iam hoc. For this use of Iam, see on ἓ 47. Hoc
anticipates ut revertantur.
