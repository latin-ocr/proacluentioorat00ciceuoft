N OTES. 1 27

Larinum ad Aurios, ‘ to the Audiat-hminum)

investigandi rat10nem = ‘ investigation.' Ratio is often
used periphrastically with a enitive ε so ratio delendi,
Quint. x, 3, 31, ‘erasure' (ie. t e process of rubbing out);
Tac. Hisc. iv. 56, ‘racio parcendi.

A. Aurius. If this is the same person as the Aurius
referred to in ξ 11 as having yielded to Sassia’s blandishments,
it is curicus to note how Cicero varies his description of him.
But alterum Aurium in ξ 25 probably is identical with the
Aurius of ἓ 11, and this is a different person. One MS. gives
M. Aurius. On the other hand PS‘l· give simply Aurius, and
so again ξ 26, 20 where ST omit the A before Aurium: the
same letter has been supplied also (by Halm and by Momm· '
sen) at ἓ 25, 6 and 8: cp. ἓ 188, 23. The explanation is probably
that in the archetype the A was made to do double duty as
possibly also the m in ipsum M. Aurium, §23 4 above:
cp. on P, Popilius, ἓ 95.

simenem, ‘active‚’ ‘enterprising‚' lit. ‘apt to try'
conclusions. So in Verr. iv. 17, 37, prompti hominis et
experienti33 Liv. vi. 34, 4, vir acer ec experiens; Hor. Ep. 1.
17, 42, pretium recte petit experiens vir. For the noun cp.
Lucr. v. 1452, usus et impiyrae simul experientia mentis.

p ς 24} denuntiarat, ‘ had given notice of his intention to
rosecu e.

clamore ac minis, hendiadys, ‘loud threatenings.'
Cp. on manibus et fflemio, ξ 13.

Q. Metelli. This was Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius (son of
Numidicus), who had left Africa to join Sulla in Italy on his
- return from the East, Ro. 83.

9 2⁵. sceleris et conscientiae, ‘his guilt and his guilty
conscience! For this use of conscientia cp. ἓ 187, timet mulier
amens non suam conscientiam ; and such expressions as magyna
vis est conscientia (pro Milone, ἓ 61; Catil. iii. ξ 27). The
phrase sceleris conscientia is also, of course, quite common3
cp. ξ 38, recentis maleficii conscientiam ξ 81, conscientiam mei
sceleris. Many edd. have et sceleris, but the et seems to have
little support from the Mss.

numquam se leg-ibus. These words are omitted in ST,
but it is obvious that they ought to stand in the text.
Amphora is a frequent source of error in Mss.; here the
eye of the copyist must have run from one numquam to
another, with the result that he wrote originally numquam
inermum inimicis, which was afterwards improved (as in ST)
into numquam inermum se inimicis.
