INTROD U ΟΤΙ ON. xxxiii

that Cluentius, as an eques, is not liable under the statute
on which the indictnient is framed. It is sufficient, in
support of the view here maintained, to cite ἓ 90, a
section which contains an express reference to‘the Lex
Cornelia as the* statute under which the charge of
‘judicial murder' was being pressed against Cluentius;
and ξ 144, from which section it clearly appears that the
allegation of bribery and corruption formed an actual
count in the indictment against him.l

But how did it come about that the prosecution
brought a charge against Cluentius under a statute to
the provisions of which they must have known he was
not amenable? The motive was probably in great part ..
political: Accius and his friends wished, by establishing
a precedent in the present case, to secure that extensi-on
of the sixt-h Chapter of the Lex Cornelia, which the
altered circumstances of judicial administration seemed
to demand. Knights as well as senators, the prosecution
urged, ought to be held liable to the statute, now that
both orders had a share in the administration of the jury—

courts (§ 145). Accius had evidently pressed this point
hard. He had professed to believe that Cicero would

found on the letter of the law (praesidio ἱερή, ἕ 143), and ,,

had appealed to the court, on the contrary, to administer
it according to the spirit z see notes 011 ἓξ 156, 160.
Behind Accius and his friends were the tribunes and the
party they championed. The leaders of the democrats,
in Ro. 66, were just as ready to criticise the constitution
of the iudicia, as administered under the Aurelian Law,
