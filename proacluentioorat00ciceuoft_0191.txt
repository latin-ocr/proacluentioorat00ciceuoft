NOTES. 131

praesentis, ‘ as he stood before them.'

omnes oderant. The desire for antithesis leads the
orator into statements which may seem to reflect on the
{ffii‘ssssifflyhssssrffiss ifflnc‘isspsffiffie 223⁸. ῃὲοἷνωῗὲἒέᾆῗῖἦιῖἓ
reach of their detestation (quem odisse iam non potestis) ; but
it is a more serious matter to say that at the trial of Oppiani-
cus his judges had already made up their minds against him.
The insertion of omnes before oderant, ducebant introduces,
however, a more general reference: Oppianicus was the
object of universal detestation, and the unanimous opinion
about him was, etc.

omni suppnclo, ‘ the severest punishment.' For omni =
summo, cp. de Amic. ξ 43, omni supplicio vindicanda; pro
Sese. ἓ 28, omni supplicio esset diynus; de Imp. Gn. Pomp.
ἓ 11, omni supplicio excruciatum necavit.

a. P. Cannutio: §5st In the Brutus, ξ 205, Cannutius

is referred to as aequalis meus, homo embra nostrum ordinem
meo iudicio disertissimus. Cp. Tac. Dial. 21.

diu=multis verbis, ‘ in a long speech,’ ‘ at great length,'
as again ἓ 147. Op. pro Rosa. Amer. ξ 89, quam diu diceres ,Ι

diceretur. Contrasted with the indicative in the pre-

· ceding sentence (auditis cum . . . dicuntur), diceretur would seem

to indicate something more than mere coincidence in time:
the jurors were under the influence of the long and telling
speech (yraviter et diu) delivered by Cannutius. Mr. Len-
drum says the difference is the same as between Fuit tempus
cum Germanos Galli superarent (Caes. B. G. vi. 24) and Fuit
cum hoc dici poterat (Liv. vii. 32).

§ 30. Et est quisquam. Indignant question: for the use
of et, cp. εἶτα in such phrases as εἶτ’ οὐκ αἰσχύνεσθε ;

Acci-vatim, lit. ‘in the gross ’ (acervus), opposed to
sinyillatim, ‘ in detail.’ See on strictim, ἓ 29.

causae, dative after propiora z huiusce = τουτουΐ. So
huiusce periculi, g 117.

vos quaeso memoria teneatis. In this phrase vos is
nominative, and stands first for emphasis: Qum is jussive
subjunctive in semi-dependence on quaeso. Cp. tu consideres
censeo dili9encer‚ ξ 135. In ξ 8 quaeso governs audiatis directly:
cp. ξ 11, and see note on ἓ 66.

hoc uti initio. It is impossible to believe that this
depends on memoria teneatis. Rather by an easy transition
-the orator passes from the constr. non ‘milti hoc esse proposi-
