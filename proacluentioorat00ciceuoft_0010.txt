vri PREFA GE,

which have led me to adopt a more or less eclectio
method in deciding between the two rival traditions
are fully set forth in the Introduction. For the
benefit of critics who may proeeed at once to search
for new matter, it may be sufficient here to refer to
the suggestion of “index words,'' of which I cannot
but think that queritur se ab Oppianico destitutum in
the traditional text of §73 is a sufficiently obvious
example. The emendations introduced at §3822 98,
103, 107, 113, 173, 192, and 195 may also claim
attention. As to the oommentary, I hope that-—
while my obligations to my predecessors will be
obvious to all who are familiar with the speech—I
may have succeeded in eliminating some of the
residuary difficulties of interpretation.

For the critical apparatus I have relied mainly
on Baiter and Faussett, citing only such variatione
in the MSS. as appeared to be of importance for a
scientific study of the text.
