viction by instituting a criminal prosecution. Under the
republic furtum was not a criminal offence bnt only a civil
wrong. Conviction on such a charge, Cicero sayS, would have
far more serious results than the notatio of the censors. The

cases, charges of theft which had not yet been made the sub·
ject of a judicial decision‚ and which were afterwards dis-
proved. Cp. ξ 121, in compluribus iam reis quos contra leffe&
