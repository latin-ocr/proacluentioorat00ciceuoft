N OTES. 157

Cicero would give way. Moreover, meo loco seems hardly so
appropriate to interpellandi or interroqandi as to respondendi,
whereas in eo loco goes equally well with all three.

an negare non potestis, ‘ You are unable, are you not ‘2'
etc. Op. ᾖ 181, An hoc dicitis? ‘ You don't say, do you?’
and see note on ἓ 60.

repetistis abstulistis. See ἓ 78.

Quo ore, ‘How can you have the face to speak of
bribery ‘2' For os, ‘ effrontery‚' cp. de Or. i. 175, quod tandem
os est eius patroni qui, etc. Cp. our word ‘brazen-faced ἐ
ovid, Epist. ex Pont. i. 1, 80, Plus isto duri, si precer, oris ero.
So in Greek, τέοισι ὄμμασι, Herod. i. 37, and ποίοις ὄμμασι,

soph. O. T. 1371.

cum ab ista parte fateamini, ‘when it was by your·
side, as you acknowledge, that,’ etc.

§ 66. Repetam paulo altius, ‘ I shall carry the thread of
my narrative a little further back.’ See on lonqius, ἓ 11.

Vos quaeso ...item quae reliqua sunt audiatis. There is
an interesting point of criticism in regard to the true reading
here. Vos is, of course, not governed by quaeso, which is in-
serted more or less parenthetically (like amabo, obsecro, ete.):
and if we may follow the analogy of ξ 30, vos quaeso memoria
teneatis, we should say that here audiatis is jussive subjunctive
in semi-dependence on quaeso. But ST give ut item, a reading
which Ι reject, though it is adopted by Baiter, Miiller, and
Faussett: to explain it one would have to suppose that
vos is direct accusative after quaeso, and that it takes the
ordinary government of verbs of asking. But while Quaeso a
vobis is common enough, Cicero has quaeso only with a direct
accusative along with another verb z quaeso oroque vos patres
conscripti, ut, etc., Phil. vii. ξ 8; te precor ac quaeso, pro
Domo, ἕ 144 , and quaeso obtestorque vos, ibid. ad fin. Now
vos is here certainly not accusative: nor is it vocative, like

pro Quinct. ἓ SGWHH, vosque qui estis in consilio,
ut, etc. It ἱοΠρ , erefore, that it is nominative, in which
case the ut before item was probably inserted 'by a scribe who
misunderstood the construction,—probably helped by the
parenthesis, ut adhuc me attente audistis. For similar uses of
quaeso in this speech, cp. ξ 8, quaeso ut me, iudices, sicut
facere instituistis, benique attenteque audiatis ; ξ 11, quod quaeso,
iudices, ne moleste patiamini: cp. also (for the position of the
pronoun)§ 135, tu consideres censeo diliqentem ἓ 195, vos ne con-
donetis roqamus3 ἓ 196, vos quaeso qui eam detulistis adsumite.
