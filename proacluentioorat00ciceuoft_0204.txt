144 PRO A. OLUENTIO.

Juv. X. 222, quot circumscripserit Hirrus papium id. xiv. 237,
xv. 135. This offence was dealt with by the Lex Plaetoria,
passed probably in the early part of the second century Β. 0. t
“it introduced the distinction, previously unknown, be·
tween minores (under 25 years of age) and maiores, and
protected the former against all kinds of fraud by enacting
that contracts with minors were legally binding only in case
of their being made in the presence of a curator appointed by
the praetor'' (Sonnenschein, on Rudens, 1381); de Off iii.
§61 3 de Nat. Deor. iii. §74.

§ 4¹7. sic statuit comparare. This use of sic with
statuere, to anticipate an infinitive clause, is more common in
Cicero with the meaning ‘to take up this posit-ion, vi2.’
Compare Sest. ξ 24, statuebam sic boni nihil exspectan-
dam: Verr. ii. 2, 9, hoc statuerunt istius iniurias per vos
ulcisci. So again, ξ 51, ita constitui, fortiter esse ayendum.

medico non ignobili, spectato homine, ‘of no mean
standing, and personally a man of repute.' Miiller bracketed
the [sed] which appears in S'r before spectato, and Dr. Reid
approves, remarking that ‘ explanatory clauses with some
case of vir or homo in apposition to a word in a preceding
clause generally stand without a conjunction. ’ Sed may have

originally been written by some copyist who had omitted non Ι

before iynobili, as in many MSS.
Cleophanto. The doctor was a Greek.

spe et pretio, ‘promises and bribes.’ Op. pretio, qratia,
spe promissis induxit aliquem (Rosc. ξ 76) and (ib. § 79) qua spe
aut quo pretio 3 pretium alone, ἓξ 47, 194.

non incallidus. The slave was ‘no fool’: cp. minime
mendax, ἓ 175. The words are by no means intended as an
expression of reproach‚ as Ramsay thinks: his defence of sed
for et in what follows is therefore without foundation.

frugi, dat. of frum, used as an indeclinable adj. ε tr.
‘ honest.' In its origin it seems to have indicated ⁶ respecta-
bility' as the result of thrift: Hor. Sat. i. 3, 49, Parcius
hic vivit: sruyi dicatur. In old Latin fraqi was a nounz
Plaut. Ps. 468, Cupis me esse nequam: tamen ero fruyt
bonae.

integer, ‘upright,' ‘incorruptible’: so ἓξ 49, 124, and
inteyritas, ἓ 133.

communicavit, ‘ conferred with ’ Baebius, told him the
circumstances. The absolute use of this verb is not very
common : de Or. i. ἐξ 66, 250. pro domo, ἓ 132; Vatin, §3;
Phil. xi. 523. Nagelsbach⁸‚ ἓ 116 (p. 457).
