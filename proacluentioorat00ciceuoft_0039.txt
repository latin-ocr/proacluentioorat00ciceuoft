side, Cicero does not scruple to work upon the fears of
the mixed tribunal he is now addressing by pointing out
the common danger that would b'e involved in such a
precedent: ἐξ 153, 157.

As bearing out the view of Cicero's argument advanced
above, and as subsidiary to the Analysis given on pp. liii.-
lv.‚ I may be allowed to quote the following from the
Introduction to my Translation, pp. 1., 11. : “Cicero starts
by saying that Accius had made two divisions of his speech.
In the first he had endeavoured to show that the statute
ouylit to be made applz‘eable to Cluentiuslz of this argument
Cicero says, quite justly, milii niti et mayno opere confidere
videbatur invidia iam inveterata iudicii Iuniani (ἕ 1).
These words do not necessarily imply that Accius had

introduced the subJ‘ect of the invidia by a side—wind, and ⁴*

not as a direct count in the indictment. They merely
contain an anticipation of the way in which Cluentius’s
advocate intends to‘meet his opponent, viz. by arguing
(ἓ 143 sq.) that the unpopularity of the conviction of
Oppianicus, and the admitted fact that bribery had been
practised'at his trial, ought not to prejudice the court
against Cluentius, especially as Cluentius is not technically
amenable to the statute on which Accius had based his
case. This latter fact—though he afterwards professes
that Cluentius does not wish to found on it (ἐξ 1445)—
Cicero at once puts forward in his reference to the second
division of the prosecutor’s speech, qua de re leye est haec
quaestio constituta (ἓ 1), and quae propria est iudicii vestri
et Zeqitimae veneficii quaestionis (ξ 2). This need not be

facinus si senator iudicio quempiam circumvenerit, Ieyibus eum
teneri: si eques Romanus hoc idem fecerit, non teneri (ἓ 145):
iniquum tibi videtum, T. Acci, esse non iisdem Ieyibus omnes
teneri (ξ 150): ayit enim sic causam T. Accius, adulescens bonus
et disertus, omnes cives leyibus teneri omnibus (ἓ 156).
