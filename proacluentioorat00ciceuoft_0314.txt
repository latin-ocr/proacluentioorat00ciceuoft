254 PRO A. O'L UENTIO.

potuistis, lit. ‘ What is there less probable that you
could have brought forward‚’ i.e. You could not have told a
n'i'ore unlikely story. For potuistis Madvig proposed possitis,
which Mr. Faussett adopts: if the mood is wrong, perhaps
potuissetis might be considered. But, as Dr. Reid remarks,
“ we cannot get rid of all the examples which Ciceronian MSS.
present of the indicative in relative consecutive clauses;
while the tense seems to yield a satisfactory meaning. ''

Atque etiam, ‘ Yes, and what- is more! Cp. ἓ 71, ad fin.

postea, cum. This is the reading adopted by most edd.
for postea quam of the MSS. Postea by itself gives a good
antithesis to primo, and cum (quom) is often, as here, confused
with quam in MSS. (ἓξ 68, 72, 192). But some recent authori-
ties would prefer postquam with the subjunctive (E. Hoffman,
Zeitpartikeln, p. 46 sqq.).

LXV. ς 182. agitata denuo, lit. ‘ being set on foot afresh.'

Tr. ‘ The examination by torture was recommenced.'

credo, ironical.

Itane tandem ⁴? derisive, ‘ Is it possible? ’

habuisset conata. est. I reject the reading of sm
(habuisses conata es) which must have been an afterthought
of some copyist. It is difficult to believe that in so involved

- a period as we have here, the orator intended to address a

direct apostrophe to Sassia. And the occurrence of the clause
ne colonum forte adficisse dicatis within the limits of the period
is obviously inconsistent with such an apostrophe.

morbo scelere, causal ablatives: ‘ distraught now by
bloodguiltiness in place of mental distemper.’

colonum: ἓξ 175, 185.

5 183. ab hoc, ‘by Accius! From the sentence at the
end of the section (quod tum. Sassia dictitavit) it would appear
that Sassia had made thisstatement, though Accius had not
availed himself of it for the defence.

ὃ· 1³'mul'torum improbitate. Tr. ‘by an unscrupulous com-
1na lon.

ii qui ad fraudem callidi sunt, ‘cunning rogues.' Ad
here: in respect of ε cp. such phrases as facilis ad intelle-
9endum, ad has res perspicax, etc„ ἓ 67 homine ad excoqitandnm
acutissimo, ad audendum impudentissimo, ad efficiendum
acerrimo. So also Livy, ix, 16, invicti ad laborem corporis
fuit: Plaut. M'erc. 630, Ad mandata claudus.

eminet atque proiecta est, ‘is conspicuous and prom-
inent.’ There 'is the same collocation in the De Repub. iii.
