152 PRO A. CLUENTIO.

111 causa e1us modi, i.e. his case was so ‘she-ky! For
in see ἓξ 13, 32.

”’ 111 honore ponerent, ‘ took as a compliment.' Cp. non
omnes in. culpa sunt ac saspzczone ponenda, ἓ 127.

ΧΧΙ. Iam hoc prope iniquissime comparatum est quod,
etc., ‘It is a most unfair arrangement that,’ etc. So Ter.
Phormio, 41, Quam ‘inique comparatumst, i qui minus habent
Ut semper aliquid addant dicioribus—One of Lagomarsini's
codices gave Iam hoc quoque prope perhaps for lam hoc
quidem prope, etc.

difficillimus, ‘ hard to treat.’

nobilissimus, of reputation or distinction (gyno-bilia).
We have here an instance of chiasmus', obscurissimus being
opposed to nobilissimus and deterrimus to optimus.

S 111ἓ {grintina capitis, ‘in trials involving civil death!
ee on .

nisi forte hoc causae est, etc. Nisi sorte is not used
here, as often in Cicero (cp. note on Quint. x. 5, δ 6) to intro-
duce an ironical argument, stating an untenable alternative,
and thereby establishing the statement previously made by a
reductio ad absurdum. Tr. ‘ The reason may perhaps be this,
that whereas a pleader must lend the weight of his moral
influence (auctoritas, ἓ 6) as we11.’ The mere pettifog ing
attorney (obscurissimus patronus) does not need to think of t at.

5 68. citatur reus. After these words most MSS. have
ayz'cur causa, and many editors accept the addition: Muller
and Faussett bracket. Even more significant, however, than
their omission in S is the misplacement of these words in Τ,
paucis aqitur causa verbis. They have no place in the text,
and have obviously crept in from the margin where A yitur
caasa (aff σᾶ) stood as a marginal guide to what was probably
a well-known passage. In ἓ 72 below we shall find reason to
believe that queritur se ab Oppianico des-titutum is a similar
ῐὸιατςὲἰῗῗὲ note which has also made its way into the text.

ut de re iudicata, to be taken closely with paucis verbis:
cp. (ξι ἀι in tegatis &elain-riis, § 14.1 ΟΞΗῐὲιιὺῂὲε dstated his case

alte petito. See on lonyius, ἓ 11.

etiam 1pss, i.e. quite gratuitously. He should have left
the mangling and maiming of his case to the other side.

quamquam sedulo faciebat, ‘ though he was really doing
his best.' For the phrase cp. Plaut. Rud. 242, Fit sedulo:
Ter. Eun. 361 Faciam sedulo.
