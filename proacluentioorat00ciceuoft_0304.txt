his client did not benefit. The MSS. give Aut heres est for At
heres esc: and Mr. Faussett thinks ac an emendation of an

bibisse. The occurrence of que in the last item of a triple
enumeration (statimque) is no ground for rejecting bibisse,
though the sentence would run equally well without it. The
