NOTE'S. 209

exam le, a censoribus.. .iudicatos esse. On this view the words
woul introduce a challenge to the prosecution to produce
facts implicating the others, —facts which might have come to
light since the censor ia subscriptio. ¹ The most suitable emenda-
tion might then be aliquid eos or aliquid censores for aliquid esse.

But ιιι view of dicant above, and Nam illud· 111 what follows
it is more probable that the challenge is addressed to the
censors. They are first (a) asked if they are going to say that
two only were guilty (duos esse corruptos solos pecunia dicant 2¹⁴)
Cicero then drives home the inferences involved in this state-
ment, viz. that the others were innocent, and that the
conviction of Oppianicus was a righteous judgment. Next
(β) he resumes, Duos solos video, etc: the censors, he says,
must either acquiesce in this view of the case, or else they
must make the alle9ation (aut illud adferant, etc.) that they
ascertained some fact implicating the others. For third
alternative supposition (Nam illud, etc.) (γ) is untena le, viz.
that they had evidence of the guilt of more than Aquilius
and Gutta, but proceeded on the analogy of military decimatio.
The view that adferant refers to the censors, not to the
prosecution‚ derives additional force from the fact that
comperisse is frequently used of the result of an investi-
gation by a magistrate. Cp. Milo, 573, where Mr. Clark
remarks that omnia comperi was Cicero’ s favourite phrase at
the time of the Catilinarian conspiracy.

The MSS. give Aut ill-ud adferant aliquid esse quod de his
duobus habueffinc compertum de ceteris comperisse. The cor-
ruption lurks in esse, which may indeed conceal a lacuna,
such, as aliquid esse postea cognitum et quod, etc. No fault
can be found with the quod clause, though most editors,
following Graevius, insert non before comperisse: it is difficult
on that reading to see the force of a challenge to the censors,
on pain of acquiescing in the statement that two only were
guilty, to make the averment that they had failed to bring
home to the rest (de ceteris non comperisse) the charge which
had been established against Aquilius and Gutta. Such a
failure, Dr. Reid thinks, might still leave the ceteri in the
position of adfines ei turpitudini. They might still be objects
of suspicion (in culpa ac suspicione ponendi). But surely the
challenge is to prove that the offence which the censors had
visited on two of the jurors had been shared in by the rest of
those who had voted for the conviction of Oppianicus: in
which case alone could their action be cited as proof that
the verdict had been procured by bribery.

¹Cp. ξ 135, from which it will appear that Egnatius senior may have
actedp independently of the consors.
