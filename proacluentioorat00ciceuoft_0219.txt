ς 68. causam bonorum Safini Atellae, ‘ the case of Safinius
Atella's estate.' Safinius seems to have been a pupillus,⁴ or
minor, whose estate, being greatly encumbered, had been
allowed to come to the hammer,—the purchasers (bonorum
emptores) taking it over bodily, assets and obligations together.
Safinius brought an action against his guardians, and placed
a sum of 600,ΟΟΟ sesterces in the hands of Staienus to secure
a favourable verdict. This money Staienus kept to himself.
He ‘ stopped ' it (suppressit) : it went no further than himself
(cp. 575, and suppressiones iudiciales, below). When judgment
was rendered he neither made restitution to Safinius, nor did
he hand over the money to the purchasers of the estate, iudicio
facto uec Safinio nec bonorum emptoribus reddidit.

Nothing is said as to how the case went : we can only infer
what the issue was from the fact that it was considered open
to Staienus to pay over the money either to Safininus or to
the bonorum emptores. It is generally supposed that Safinius
lost. The analogy of Staienus's conduct in the case of
Oppianicus (ἓ 69, adfin.) is referred to. But this is somewhat
misleading‚ as the circumstances of the two trials were differ-
ent. Staienus calculated that the convictiou of Oppianicus

· would leave him with the money in hand (damnato repetiturum
esse neminem, ἓ 69), but the failure of Safinius to make qood
his case a9aiust his 9uardians could not be expected to have
the same result. It is more probable that Safinius won. Of
the two alternative courses open to Staienus, restitution to
Safinius is mentioned first : and it seems a fair inference that
the natural step for Staienus to have taken would have been
to refund to Safinius money which had been given to him for
a particular purpose, and which had either not been required
to influence the court in favour of Safinius‚ or had been kept
back by Staienus from purely interested motives. The
suggestion that, failing this, Staienus might have handed the
money over to the bonorum emptores, may be explained in this
way. The success of Safinius upset the purchase. The estate
had probably been transferred and the money paid by the
time Safinius came to be sui iuris, and in a position, therefore,
to raise the action. The bonorum emptores would obviously
have a claim for the return of the purchase money, and the
suggestion is that, the case having been won without bribery,
the money that had been placed at Staienus's disposal for
that purpose could have been applied in partial satisfaction
of that claim. It does not seem to be necessary to suppose,
as editors do, that the money came out of the estate. Cer-
