214 PRO A. C'LUENTIO.

illa iudicia. The demonstrative is said to be wanting in
τὴς Turin palimpsest, but occurs in all the other MSS. It
seems almost indispensable to the sense, as the reference is
to the courts as formerly constituted, i. e. while the senate had
the monopoly of thern. ·

ς 131. nihil habuisse comperti. Cp. habuerint com-
pertum, ἓ 127.

ἓ 130 rumorem, see on rumusculos, ἓ 105: quaesitum, see on

quo : see on ξ 9, where the usage is exaetly similar.

idipsum, lit. that taken by itself, to go no further: cp.
on ipsum nomeu, ἓ 12.

quantae divinationis est: ‘ what a power of guess work
(ἓ 97) it implies,' what a gift of second-sight. For the genitive
cp. vestri auxilii est subvenire, ξ 4.

cum dixerunt is the reading of all MSS. : editors,
except Miiller and Faussett, have substituted dixerint. In
this adversative use of cum (‘whereas,' ‘although'), “the

coincidence in time serves to set off strongly the unreasonable-
ness of the action ’' (Bolus, ς 1731).

homines sapientissimi, iudices. It is best to understand
iudices here as = cum iudices essent, i. e. ‘ sitting on the bench
of jurors,' and so well qualified to judge: cp. ἓ 121, Primum
iudices, senatores equitesque Romani.

§ 132. condemnat iudicat. Note the force of these
terms in th'e context ι ‘it is a conviction that Gellius records
against Popilius : his verdict is,' etc. 3 Lentulus on the other
hand ‘ takes an opposite view ’ (nequi hoc Lentulus).——The
most that Cicero can make out here is that while both censors
concurred in removing Popilius from the senate, they assigned
different reasons for their action : contrast quod erat libertini
filius (objective statement of fact) with quod is pecuniam
accepisset, ἕ 131, above (subjunctive of reported reason). It
by no means follows that Lentulus made any formal denial of
the charges as stated in his colleague's subscriptio.

libertini filius. This supports the view that Appius
Claudius in his censorship (Β.ο. 312) made the ‚qrandsons of

gegzdingn 2esligible for a seat in the senate, not the sons z Hor.
α . 1. . .

locum quidem, etc. Quidem is here adversative : cp. 011
ἓξ 54, 50: also interea quidem, § 155 below. Similarly Or.
ς 62, id uos fortasse uon perfecimus, conati quidem saepissime
sumus.

ludis. For this ablative, cp. ἓ 27, ludis aut festis diebus.
