IN TROD U G‘TION. li

nocentis: ἓ 64, 12 habes for habeam: ἓ 84, 11 coucilia-
tionis mutiam for conciliationem qratiae: ἓ 93, 18
seditiones for seditiose: ἓ 94, 27 repetundis for residuis:
ἓ 94, 3 publice for posse: g 127, 1 et intimum Guttam for
in T. Guttam ; ibid. 4 ut uon for uon ut: g 149, 24 te α
me desiderare for a me desiderari. Sometimes it seems as
if the original of ST may have been a MS. abounding in
contractions, which were liable to be misinterpreted τ eq.
in ἓ 12, 11 s has civitate for eupiditate: in ἓ 112, 6 both
s and 'r give civis in place of vitiis ; while words which
easily lend themselves to eontracted forms are sometimes
omitted, like eausam, ξ 120, 22 : iudicium, ἕ 116, 14.

An appeal might be made to the MSS. of Quintilian to
decide between the rival readings. But we find that
Quintilian's text sometimes supports the one family,
sometimes the other3 and besideS, Quintilian, though he
cites Cicero so frequently, was seldom at pains to quote
correctly, and therpeculiarities of his version are very
generally reproduced by the grammarians and rhetori-
cians of a later date. The most interesting passages ¹'for
comparison are ἓ 11, 17 facile princeps ω, princeps s'r and
Quint„ iv. 2, 13οε ἓ 15, 14 timuisse ω and Quint„ iv. 2,
105, timuisti ST ε g 58, 12, where ΒΤ and Quint„ vi. 3, 40,
agree in omitting respicite iudices homiuum soi-tumis ε cp.
ξ 63, 10, ξ 64, 22, and ξ 143, where see critical notes.
