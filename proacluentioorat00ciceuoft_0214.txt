154 PRO A. CLUE'NTIO.

An vero rescinderent? The An here is really dis-
junctive, the first alternative being involved in the preceding
clause. Originally an may have been a simple interrogative,
but a comparison of instances from the text of this speech
will show that its characteristic use in Cicero is to introduce
somewhat abrupt questions (or, then) containing a remon-
strance or an ironical alternative. Here An rescinderent
serves to urge the acceptance of the proposition laid down in
the preceding sentence: lit. “ Or ought they to have cancelled'':
“ you would not have had them cancel their previous verdicts,
would you ‘t '' So ἓ 65, Quid tacetis ‚2 An neyare non potestis?
‘ You can't deny then‘2’: ξ 136, Suscepit causam. An potuit
repudiare, ‘ It took the matter up. Well, it couldn't have
let it alone, could it? '' z ξ 181, Quid quisquam suspicari
aliud potest ? An hoc dicitis, ‘ You don't say do you? ’

ᾗ 61. ina iudicia senatoria, referring to the old senatorial
monopoly of the law-courts, which was still in force at the
time of trial of Oppianicus, B.o. 74. Under the compromise
effected in B.c. 70 by the Lex Aurelia, the jurors were now
selected in equal proportions from the senate, the equites,
and the tribuni aerarii. See Introd., p. xxix,

English idiom implying a reference to the moment of speaking.

si qui is found in the best MSS„ for the more usual si
qui-3. There is really no difference between the two forms,
though hiatus seems to have been avoided with a short i
following. See Reisiq-Haase, note 356, p. 61.
