NOTES. 153

praevaricari accusat1on1, ‘ to bo acting in collusion with

the prosecution.' The word is more usually (6.9. 987) em-

loyed of a prosecutor who pla s into the hands of the defence

By concealing true charges, an enerally by the crooked con-

duct (prae, varus) of his case. ost editors reject accusationi

on the ground that praevaricari is not found elsewhere in
Cicero with a dative.

ex intimo artmo1o, ‘from the secrets of his stock-in-
trade.' For artificium, of technical knowledge, or system, cp.
ἕ 75269. cetera de 1110 loco, ‘ the rest of his clap-trap,' i. e.‚ the
verba qravissimm eonveying the hackneyed appeal Respicite
respicite. Dc is here not ‘ concerning,' but of the ‘source
from which': §9st Locozloco communi, a ‘stock passage.'
For these loci communes see note on Quint. x. 5. 12: and cp.
· lb. v¹'ticillo obtorto, ‘by the scruff of the neck.' So Plaut.

Rud. 853, Pecu. 789: obtorta mela, Verr. iv. §24

reliqua perorare, ‘ to conclude his peroration.’

XXII. Fabriciorum, ie. C. Fabricius and his accomplice
Scamander. So Fabricios, ἓξ 60, 62. Only one of the brothers
was alive at the time (ξ 47). Scamander again, as libertus of
the Fabricii, might take the family name.

loeus primus. See on ἕ 56.

quae nune ego omnia omitto. This is the reading of s
supported by W, thou h in the latter syo has dropped out.
Nunc was probably above the line in the archetype: hence
itsomission in Τ, and its trans osition in ΕΜ (eqo omnia nunc).
But it probably formed part o the original text.

ministrum Oppianici. Pluygers proposed to bracket
Oppianici, but there is an evident emphasis in the repetition
of the name : cp. de Oppianico iudicarant, immediately above.

5 00. Utrum, i.e. which of the alternatives presented

in the two following clauses, each introduced by quod (‘ the
fact that,' etc.).

omnino ausus est, i.c. that he ventured on any reply
at all. For this use of omnino (τὸ παράπαν) cp. g 168.

in opplamco. For this use of in c. abl. see on in eius
modi iniuriis, ἓ 13.

debuerunt, i.s. as a matter of fact—even granting that
Fabricius and Scamander (Fabricios) had been wrongly
sentenced——they were bound to be consistent. The state-

ment contained in debuerunt is independent of the condition.
So often possum, licetz Roby, 5 1566.
