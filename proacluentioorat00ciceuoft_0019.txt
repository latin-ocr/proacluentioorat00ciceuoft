INTROD UCTION. xv

conviction of Oppianicus. O. Junius, the iudex·
quaestionis, was impeached on technical grounds and

found guilty (gg 79, 89). Several of the jurors were

prosecuted on various charges, though in every case it f.
was their alleged corruption at the trial of Oppianicus

that influenced the jury to bring in an adverse verdict. -2
One only (Fidiculanius Falcula) was (lirectly impeached,

and in his case a double trial resulted in acquittal‘
(gg 103-4). The censors affixed their official stigma

in a comprehensive way, the conduct of any who might

have been guilty of bribery at a criminal trial (ἓ 136).

The death of Oppianicus took place about two years
after his trial, i.e., in the year B.c. 72. Sassia attempted
at the time to extort from certain slaves under torture
some declaration that would compromise her son, but
altogether without success, Three years afterwards.
one of these slaves, Strato by name, committed theft
and murder in her house, and she seized the oppor-
tunity of putting him again to the torture. This time
she professed to have obtained some sort of evidence
incriminating Cluentius3 and it was on the strength of
this evidence that she persuaded the younger Oppianicus

to institute the present proceedings.
’ It is probable that Cluentius was acquitted‚ as the

result of Cicero's able advocacy. He may have been
altogether innocent of the death of his step-father, though
we shall find reason to discount some of the arguments
which his advocate adduces in his favour. Cicero ,⁷
represents Oppianicus as living a life so wretched (ἓ 175)
that no one who bore him any ill-will would have wished
to release him from his misery. But from some of
the incidents of the narrative we might be inclined to
