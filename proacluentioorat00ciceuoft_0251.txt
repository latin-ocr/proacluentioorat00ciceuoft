voting at the trial of Oppianicus z see Introd. p. xxii. sq. The
'translation of the abl. abs. iven above is justified by the
fact that no further hearing o the case ever came on. Those
who voted Non liquet did their best to secure an ampliatio,
but were unsuccessful, Opgianicus being found guilty at the
first hearing of the case: icero wishes his hearers to infer
that if a second trial had been ordered they would have
swelled the majority against Oppianicus by voting ‘ Guilty.’

§ 10¹7. sapientes. Taken with eorum vero qui sibi non
liquere dixerunt sapientiam laudo in the last sentence (and
homines sapientes, ἓ 76), this ought to be sufficient proof that
the nine names which follow are those of the jurors who
voted Non liquet. But this would give a minority of only
fourteen (nine for ‘ Not Proven,' and five for acquittal) against
eighteen for a conviction, whereas we are told in the pro
Caecina, ἓ 29, that the issue depended on a single vote. The
number of those who voted Non liquet must have been, not
nine, but ten. Possibly Cicero may be quoting a certain
number (lonyum est de sinyulorum virtute ica dicere) of names
from the list both of those who voted ‘Not Proven' and of
those-who gave a direct verdict of ‘ Guilty ' z but see Introd.

Non absolvit. Cicero is trying to get all the benefit he
can out of the Non Liquet vote: cp. Ne is quidem absolvit,
quorum nullius sententia est Oppianicus absolutus, in eadem sen-
tentia suit. The other side might just as well, from their point
of view, have said Non condemnavit. But Cicero wishes his
hearers to believe that the Non Liquets were only postponing
the}J day of reckoning: cp. qui distulit cautus.. existimatur,

Ne 1s quidem absolvit. ‘ No more did he acquit him‚’
or ‘ He didn't aequit him either.’

quae [quia] cognita sunt. If the MS. reading were
correct, this neuter plural would be very loosely attached to
what goes before. It were tedious, Cicero says, to complete
the enumeration, and to say thinys which are so familiar as
not to require any rhetorical ornament. Various conjectural
emendations are enumerated in the critical note ad loc. Ι

arisen from some kind of dittography. The words then
