xxiv PRO Α. GL UENTIO.

Egnatius. If the nine honourable men whose names
are recited in ξ 107 had concurred in this verdict,
Cicero would have claimed them as witnesses against
Oppianicus in more emphatic language than 116 actually
uses in the section under discussion.1 Moreover, he
professes to be merely selecting certain names from a
number at his disposal, whereas (on Ramsay's theory)
he could really not have added a single one more.
Nine are mentioned in all, and 9÷8=17. The fact
seems to be that in ἓ 106 116 begins to divide the
bench into two classes—those who acquitted, and those
who did not acquit3 and the names mentioned in g 107
are the names of nine of those who voted Non Liquet.

To make up the minority of 15 we must suppose that
there was a tenth juror who gave this verdict, and

whose name is omitted from' the list. The only
possible alternative would be to suppose that, with the
view of vindicating the justice of the verdict, Cicero
is quoting in g 107 a certain number of reputable
names from the list both of those who gave a direct
verdict of “Guilty,” and of those who voted “Not
Proven’'; but this seems hardly so probable.

The conduct of Staienus is another matter in regard
to which the orator's statements are hardly convincing.
He receives a large sum of money, amounting to
64Ο,ΟΟΟ sesterces (about fi5,440), for distribution
among sixteen jurors: his own vote was regarded as
certain, as he had already voted for the acquittal of
Scamander, and fully expected to be rewarded also on
the present occasion (spe maiorum praemiorum, ἓ 74).
This money Cicero represents Staienus as having
schemed to keep entirely to himself, though he was
subsequently forced to disgorge the whole of it (ἓ 78).

1 Non absolvit—ne is quidem absolvit—quorum nullius sententia
est Oppianicus absolutus—in eadem sententia fuit, ἕ 107.
