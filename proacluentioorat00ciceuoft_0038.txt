xxxiv PRO A. OLUENTIO.

as the opponents of senatorial monopoly had been in
earlier days They saw no good reason why the provisions
of the Lex Cornelia should continue to be technically
applicable only to senators and officials who had held
magistracies by popular election, while there was'no means
of bringing to justice others who, like Cluentius, were
charged with having corrupted members of senatorial
juries. Their object accordingly was to secure an ex-
tended application of the Lex Cornelia, by the precedent
which they hoped would be established by the conviction
of Cluentius: uec nuuc quidquam ayitur—milii credite

opportunity was a favourable one. Many who had voted

for the conviction of Oppianicus had themselves been con-
demned on a criminal charge, and the censors had taken
official cognizance of the scandal by stigmatizing, among
others, Cluentius himself. The prosecution must have
hoped—especially as the defendant was being impeached
“ also under another section of the same statute—that
equitable considerations would prevail, and that the jury
before which Cluentius appeared would not prejudice
itself in the eyes of the people by refusing, on technical
groundS, to convict the defendant of a crime of which he
was believed really to be guilty. Cicero meets these ex-
pectations in the language of emphatic protest. He objects
to the attempt, to extend to others—whether equestrian
j urors (de eis qui rem iudicarint, ξ 152) or members of the
general public (populus Romanus, ἐξ 151, 157)—a statute
which Sulla had expressly limited to members of that order
on which he was conferring the monopoly of the J‘ury courts,
probably because he recognized the fact that it would
be mainly from members of the senatorial order that his
new jurors would be exposed to the risk of bribery and
corruption. And in rebutting the arguments of the other
