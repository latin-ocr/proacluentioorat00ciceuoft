264 PRO A. CLUENTIO.

Cael. 73. Perorare here=to plead throughout: for the
meaning to ‘ finish pleading‚’ see on ἓ 6. Vetere instituto has
geelnmrgigdglrgggksl‘eaccordmg to my old custom '’ (ἓ 144), but this

caecam crudelitate et scelere ferriz ‘ carried along in all
the blindness of inhumanity and sin.’ For ferri, cp. on ἓ 12.

vitiis animi, abl. of instrument. Tr. ‘ In the depravity
of her mind she has dragged in the dust all the binding
ordinances of society. ’ Iura hominum includes the perversion
of relationships stigmatized below, but has probably a more
extended meaning.

homnem, ‘a human being,’ without reference to seX, as
often ἄνθρωπος.

nomina necessitudinum, ‘ the designations of relation-

, ship,'——artificial as contrasted with naturae nomen et iura, for

which cp. naturae nomen, ἓ 12.
filiae pelex: ‘ the mistress of her daughter-'s husband.’

ad similitudinem hominis, ‘in the likeness of humanity. '
Fausset here compares, wrongly as Ι think, ad fraudem
calcidi, § 183. Ad 1n this passage: κατὰ rather than εἰς, and

means ‘in accordance with' cp. ad normam, ad hunc
modum, Roby, 1826.

ξ 200. liberum, a vague plural, as in ἓ 31.

Sin autem, formally adversative to si scelus odistis,
above. ‘And again, by your love of,' etc. For postulat cp.
ἕ 66, fautore cupidiore quam fides iudicis postulabat.

periL' Op. de communibus invidiae periculis, ἓ 8.

post illam flammam, sc. invidiae: cp. ἓ 4, quasi in
aliqua perniciosissima flamma.

aliorum facto et cupiditate, ‘ the villainy and avarice of
others.’ Ernesti's conjecture, fraude forfacto is unnecessary:

a word like factum is apt to acquire an evil sense from the
context in which it occurs. Cp. rnon de illorum facto, ἓ 118.

cui posita sunt 111 vobis omnia: ‘his all is in your
hands.’ Cp. ἓ 146, mens civitatis posita est in leyibus.

§12 servatum esse cupiunt. See on interfhctmn cupit,

ξ 201. in iudiciis valere non debet: cp. §5‚ in hoc loco
