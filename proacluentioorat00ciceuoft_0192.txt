bam⁴ ut to the simple infinitive sed [mihi propositum 0880]
hoc uti initio, etc. The recurrence of Ῐιοο four times in the sen-
tence is remarkable.

ad hanc mortem repentinam, generally rendered, ‘in
addition to this sudden death‚' the indicia et vesciyia veneni
being cited as further evidence. Cp. in Vatin„ ἓ 20, si ad
cetera vulnera hanc quoque mortiferam playam inflixisses,
where quoque corresponds to praeterea in the text. Dr. Reid,
however, would render ‘ on the occurrence of ἐ cp. Roby,
ἓ 1824, and Liv. ix. 7, 7, ad famam obsidionis dilectus haberi
coeptus erat, ‘following on the report.'

XI. § 31. Eodemque veneno, ‘ by poison likewise.

in ipso fraterno parricidioff in the murder of a brother
taken by itseffl' i. e. without going outside it, you have every
form of bloodguiltiness. Parricidium used to be explained
as a contracted form of patri· cidium or parenti· -cidium‚ an ex·
tended signification having been given to the word when it
came to be applied to wilful murder of any kind. Modern
philologists prefer to connect the first part of the word with
*parrus, ‘ open, ’ '‘parsus, ‘companion, ' one who ‘offers him-
self' (pareo, appareo, parra, sc. avis).

aditum.. ‚munivit. Cp. the common phrase, munire
viam, used both literally and figuratively.

ut. .necaretur indicates purpose. his object was to get
rid of the child that stood between him and his brother' s

estate

1110 poculo mortis, ‘that deathful draught.' Illo is
emphatic τ the cup was mixed with the drug which Oppianicus
knew so well how to use. Cp. Eodemque veneno above.
Mortis is said by editors to be unusual for morbi-'fero : but cp.
mortis insidiis, ἓ 201.

011111 de.. walamaret ‘when he was calling out upon)

liberos ‘offs pring '—an example of the use of the plural
for rhetorical effect(§§ 125 ,200). Cp. the indefinite neuter abov ⁷,e
illud quod erac ex fratre conceptum, and again ἓ 33 adfin.

hanc a natura lucem accipere, ‘take 1n the kindly light
of day.' Many Mss. and edd. have propriam lucem, ywhich
commentators do not endeavour to account for. If propriam
did not make its way into the text quite gratuitously‚ from
prius in the line above, I incline to think that it may have
resulted from the misreading of an adscript propitiam, ‘kindly
light) Hanc a natura lucem, without any adjective, is quite
in Cicero's style· Tusc. i. ξ 12, omnes. ..qui hac luce careant,
