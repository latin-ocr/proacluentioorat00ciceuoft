xxviii PRO A. CLUENTIO.

hear so much in the present speech, and which was
headed by Oppianicus’s counsel, the tribune Quinctius,1
He raised a series of actions against the jurors who had
taken bribes at the late trial, and also set in motion
against them the machinery of the censorial' stigma.
Cicero makes much of the fact that in most cases their
alleged conduct at the trial of Oppianicus was not made
the main charge against these offenders. Possiblyv there
may have been a motive for this. The senatorial juries
which tried the cases could not have convicted on a
direct charge of bribery without discrediting their own
order. But they had to yield to the inevitable. The
feeling of resentment over the exclusive privileges of the
senators was so strong that it was easy to secure a
conviction on any charge which it might be convenient
to put in the foreground in dealing with each particular
case. Thus it is said of Junius himself, idcirco illis
leqibus condemnatus est quod contra aliam leqem eom-
mz‘serat (ἓ 92). Similarly Bulbus, on his trial for
· maiestas, is at the same time accused of having taken
a bribe at the trial of Oppianicus (ἓ 97); and Staienus,
when also on his trial for maiestas, had to face the
argument which the Cominii founded on his conduct as
one of the jury in that case (ξ 99; cp. ἓ 114).
Cicero’s attitude in connection with the impeachment
of Verres shows us that he shared in the popular resent-
nient against the senatorial administration ; see especially
i. Verr„ ἓ 38, ii. 4, g 133. There is, indeed, a passage in the
present speech in which he sets it in a fairer light: tum
vero illa iudicia senatoria ‘non falsa invidia, sed vera atque
imaqm· tuoyoitadioze notata atque operta dedecore et infamia,
defensioni locum ‘nullum reliquz'sent, ἓ 61 . But this may have
been because he felt that it was his interest to uphold
the character of the tribunal which had, in condemning
