N OTES. 251

omnibus rebus ornati: ‘with every honourable recom-
mendation.' For the significance of this admission that (in
spite of the language used in ἓ 170) the friends of Oppianicus
and Sassia were persons of character (honesti) with ‘every
virtue, every grace,' see Introd. p. xvi.

et spe et metu : ‘promises and threats.’ So ξ 47, spe et
pretio: ἕ 191, sollicitationes servorum et minis et promissis.

auctoritate advocatorum t ‘it was the moral support of
the witnesses (see on advocabat, §54) [and the intensity of the
torture] that led them to hold by the truth.’ For auctoritas,
see on ἓ 57. The words et vi tormentorum occur in all mss„
but are rejected by many editors. I have bracketed them,
believing that they have all the appearance of an interpolation
by a copyist who had read accounts of similar investigations:
e.‚q. Tac. Ann. xiV. 60, Actae ob id de ancillis quaestiones, et vi
tormentorum victis quibusdam ut salsa adnuerent plures
perstitere sanctitatem dominae tueri. It must have been
matter of common experience that torture on such occasions
induced obstinacy: Tac. Hist. i. 3. contumax etiam adversus
tormenta servorum fides: Ann. iv, 29, etiam si tormenta
pervicacia servorum contra evenissent. But while this would
explain the insertion in the margin of a grim note like et vi
tormentorum, it is difficult to believe that Cicero would have
shown such questionable taste as to couple the phrase with
auctoritate advocatorum. He really meant his hearers to
understand that it was their reliance on the moral support of
the advocati that induced the slaves to stand firm, it was this,
in fact, that secured the adjournment of the first inquiry
(quaestio dimissa est, ξ 177), and afterwards finally put an
end to the examination (quibus finem aliquando amicorum
auctoritas fecit, ἕ 191). But Cicero could hardly, in this
context, have perpetrated such a παρὰ προσδοκίαν as is implied
in the words et vi tormentorum: while, if he had intended to
condjo‘int twot fagtssrs ⁸⁰cdi.ss‚³imila¹'’ he would probably have
sai e auc ori a e e vi.

ς 1⁷¹7. Quaestio 1110 die: Et illo quidem die quaesti0‚ etc.

de integ-ro. De here indicates the ‘basis ’ or ‘ starting-
point ' (Roby, 1907) ε so Verr. ii. ἕ 139, Censores dicit de
inteyro sibi creari placere. Cp. de industria, de improviso.
In the same way should be explained de amicorum sententia,
two lines above ε cp. de Oppianici sententia, ἓ 55.

Adversarl, hist. inf.: the witnesses expostulate. The
alternative reading aversari must be rejected as not Ciceronian ι
in Verr. ii. 5 187, the true reading seems to be versari
(haerere homo, versari, rubere). The word is found, however,
in Tac. Dial. 20, where it seems to be used absolutely.
