tum, on the occasion of his trial.

sceleri Oppianici, ‘to that scoundrel of an Oppianicus.
Scelus was used colloquially as a term of reproach, and occurs
frequently in the comic poets. Plautus also has scelus viri,
‘ you scoundrel of a fellow,’ scelus pueri, flaqitium hominis, etc.
For a similar colloquialism in Cicero, cp. Fam. v, 8, 2, quae-
dam pestes hominum: in Pis„ 5 56, ο scelus, o pestis, o labes!
ΟΡ. also 5 188, Quod tam infestum scelus ec immane, aut

§ 3⁵. obtestatione, ablative of external cause. This construc-
tion is not very common in early and classical Latin, except
in certain formulae. Faussett compares Phil. i. 5 30, se bene-
ficio ‘novo memoriam veteris doloris abiecisse, and Catullus, xiv.

names of tribes: Cic. Verr. i. 523, Q. Verres Romilia.

admota, ‘ brought to bear,’ viz. on Asuvius.

inire: so Baiter, Kayser, Ramsay, Miiller. There can
be little doubt that this reading should be preferred to iniri
(Classen, Faussett): the form of the sentence makes it
probable that two similar infinitives were to stand at the
beginning of each clause. The examples of a change of con-
struction from passive to active, quoted by commentators,
do not seem to be in point.
