incipio. For the present, cp. 011 ἓ 6.
de meo officio, ‘about my own personal relations.’

huiusce periculi, ‘ the danger in which my client stands ἰ
so sine huius periculo, ἓ 118 below, and huiusce vitae periculum,
ἓ 188. For this use of periculum, see on ξ 18. The alter-

native reading cum huiusce periculo (omitting tum) is very
difficult with quoque. tr. ‘that I may show that I have been

mindful of my other obligations αι the peril of my client)

ratio conservata. Cp. rationem habere alicuzus rei, to
‘take account of' a thing, give it consideration. A parallel

may be found m the phrase officia retinere, ἓ 133.

proxime, ‘,recently' i. e. in B. c. 70, while the date of the
speech is 66. It was in this year, the year of the first
consulship of Pompeius, that the census is said to have been
revived‚ having been allowed to lapse since the dictatorship
of Sulla (Β. c. 82). The censors were Cn. Cornelius Lentulus
and L. Gellius (cp. ξ 120), and they showed great severity in
the exercise of their powers.

altero: Lentulus, ἓ 118. plerique: see on ἓ 39.
magnus usus: so ξ 49.

summa ...necessitudo. A parallel passage in pro Reye
Deiotaro, ἓ 39, seems to be decisive in favour of necessitudo
as against consuetudo: quocum mihi amicitiam ies-publica
conciliavit.. .summam vero necessitudinem magyna eius officia
in mc et in exercitum meum effecerunt. The esc which 1s found
in most codd. after necessitudo may be omitted from the text:
it probably results from the tendency of copy ists already
referred to (see on se...opplicavit, ἓ 66) to repeat a word.
immediately beside the word with which it is connected.
Ciceronian usage would have led us to expect rather maqnus
est usus et, etc. Usus and consuetudo of course often occur
together, with very little difference of meaning (Phil. vii. 6,
Sex. Rosa. ἓ 15), but the insertion of consuetudo here probably
arose from its resemblance to constituta, especially in con-
tracted form; out of this arose cons uetudo vel necessitudo (a
reading cited from a Palatine MS. of Gruter); after which
necessitudo was restored, with est to balance est amicitia

above.

5 118. subscriptionibus, strictly of the reason assigned
(cum istam ipsam causam subscriberent, ἓ 119: cp. for an
actual example ἓ 131) for the nota or stigma. Cp. on anim-
adversio, ἓ 117.

omnem orationem means ‘ every word I say.'
ratione censoria, ‘ the censorial system in generaL'
