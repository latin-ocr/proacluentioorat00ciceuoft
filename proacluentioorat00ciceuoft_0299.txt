 

N OTES. 239

Sest. ξ 125, cui nos offensi invisique fuerimus: in Verr. 3. 62,
invidiosum offensumque.

reug-loni. For reliyio of the ‘ voice of conscience,'
especially in connection with the oath of a juror, cp. ἕ 121,
suae potius reliyioni qvam censorum opinioni paruerunt : ἐξ 107,
159. The gloss in s'r after Est enim sapientis iudicis [memin-
isse se hominem] is interesting as showing what copyists were
capable of.

§ 159. tantum quantum, ‘just so much as‚’ ‘so much,
and so much only, as 'z i.e. the juror’s functions are limited by
the extent of his commission.

posse, of moral courage: a wise juror must have the
strength of mind to aequit, must be able to ‘ bring himself to '
(like τλῆναι in Greek tragedy) aequit, even where the defen-
dant is the object of his detestation.

de quo reo cognoscat: ‘the character of the accused
whose case he is examining.’

magni atque sapientis, ‘ noble and wise.’ Magynus of
moral quality = maynanimus, ‘ high-souled‚’

non se reputare. The order is, reputare uon se solum
esse neque...licere. There is much, however, to be said in
favour of the alternative reading, ozon se puta-re esse solum.
The phrase habere in consilio supplies an antithesis to solum
esset the juror must ‘take for his assessors' the law, con-
science, righteousness, good saith) For consilium in this
sense, cp. on adhibitis amicis, ἓ 33.

conscientiam mentis suae, ‘ the testimony of his own
conseiemgg, For conscientia in the sense of ‘ guilty conscience‚'
see on ἓ ,

summa cum honestate vivemus, ‘ our lives will be in the
highest sense virtuous. ' Metus in the context = religious or
moral apprehension.

§ 160. iudicem quod ei videatur, etc„ ‘ that a juror has
to decide as he thinks best, and ought not to be fettered by
statutes.’ Accius must have appealed to the jury to rise
above the technical restrictions of the statute ε to look to its
spirit, not to its letter. Otherwise it would have been im-
possible to expect a conviction against a Roman knight for an
offence which, at the time of its alleged commission, was
indictable under the statute only in the case of senatorial
jurors. Accius had in fact appealed to the jurors to establish
a wholesome precedent by convicting Cluentius, and so
making the altered and enlarged statute even retrospective in
its action. Cp. Introd. xxxiii.
