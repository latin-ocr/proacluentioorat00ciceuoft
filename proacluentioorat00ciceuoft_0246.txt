186 PRO A. OLUENTIO.

double complaint against J unius was, as we have seen (vide
note on §91)‚ that (α) in impanelling Fidiculanius he had
made an irregular selection (as Fidiculanius did not belong
to the decury which was to serve in the quaestio de veneficiis),
and that (b) he had neglected to consult the city praetor, on
whose register the name of Fidiculanius ought to have been
entered (α) non suae decuriae ‘munere (b) neque ex Zeye:
cp. si ex Zeqe subsortitus non erat Iunius, §92 The hrase
decuriae iudicum is said to have origiuated at the perio when
the Quaestiones Perpetuae were first established. Ten jurors
seem to have been selected from each tribe, making a total of
350 liable to serve; and these formed the Album Indicum
Selectorum. After B.c. 70 each of the three classes from
which the iudices were taken (senators, knights, and tribuni
aerarii) formed a decury‚ and the Album was made up by the
praetor out of these.

prima actione ε see on ἓ 55.

Non numero hanc absolutionem, ‘ I waive this acquittal‚’
‘leave it out of the reckoning,' So ad Act. xvi. 4. 4, Nam

Cassii classem non numero ultra fretum.

ut illam multam non commiserit, ‘ granting that he did
not incur that particular fine,' or ‘ did not commit the offence
which would have made him liable to the fine.’

accepisse tamen ob rem iudicandam pecuniam, sicut
causam pecunia capta nusquam Staienus eadem lege (fixit.

The MSS. (which coincide except that F has captam for capta)
show no trace of any lacuna such as I have endeavoured to fill
by the words pecuniam sicut causam pecunia, where indeed the
first pecuniam might be dispensed with (except so far as it
may help to explain, by the recurrence of the same word, the
source of the corruption), if we understand accepisse as used
absolutely : see ξ 75, ἓ 113, and elsewhere. Cp. ἓ 65, where
owing to the recurrenee of iudicium the essential words datam
post iudicium are omitted in sax} {The corruption may indeed
extend more widely, one of the main difficulties of the passage
being that the transition is nowhere indicated from the first
trial of Fidiculanius to the second. Eadem leye, if it means
‘ under the same statute as Falcula on his second trial ' would
seem to show that this transition must already have been
made in what has fallen out: the words Fidiculanius quid
fecisse dicebatur ? would then follow quite naturally. On the
other hand these words may themselves form the transition‚
though this would have been made clearer if Sed altero iudicio
had been prefixed, to correspond with Uno iudicio ten lines

above.
