quae inimicitiae Scamandro cum Habito. Here Kayser
proposed to insert fuissent, but it might almost seem as if the

which the sentence closes.

hominis exercitati, ‘ a past-master in the art of wife
murdzrentura fuisse, i.e. ‘in the event of Cluentius’s death)

patrono probatum, ‘bore a good character with his
master.' Probatus with a dative has an adjectival sense: so
Verr. ii. 17, si cuiquam yeueri homiuum probatus sit: and
the superlative tibi probatissimos, Ligar. §32 Scamander
was ‘acceptable to' his master. Fabricius had tested him
and found him not wanting: he ‘vouched’ for him. Op.

hoc loco, ‘ at this point‚' ‘in this part of my argument.’

rather than as real agents, hence the a l. without prep. Cp.
ad Q. Fr. iii. 3, Odio premitur omnium ymerum, mamime
testibus caeditur. Tr. ‘ My case broke down under the weight
of evidence given by highly reputable persons.'

de suo consilio, ‘ at his suggestion.' For this use of de,

cum veneno pecuniaque. On the ‘enlargement' of the
narrative, as now unfolded by Cicero, see Introd.‚ p. xviii.

Habito, ‘against Habitus‚' dat. incommodi. Cp. Plaut.
