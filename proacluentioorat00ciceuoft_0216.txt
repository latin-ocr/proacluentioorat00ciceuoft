qui sibi alia ratione diffideret, ‘ who had no other re-
’ source to trust to‚' i. e. than bribery. Alia ratione, literally,
‘ on any other method’: cp. qui spem salutis in alia ratione
‘non habuerit, below. The antithesis (alia ratione diffideret),
omni ratione confideret, may be rendered ‘ no other ground of
confidence‚’ ‘ every ground of confidence.'

third hypothesis—that both parties were guilty—is carefully
eliminated. See Introd. p. xxi-xxii.

de 1110 ipso, probably masculine, ‘ about Oppianicus.’
The phrase might, however, have reference t'o the preceding
clause, ‘ on that very point,' i. e. the bribery by Oppianicus.

For this use of periculum, cp. on ἓ 49.

so ξ 168, ex illo loco: cp. 579, hoc praesertim in {0003 ξ 54, hoc
ipso in loco. This is the reading of most codd„ which I retain
with some hesitation, against the authority of STF. The
alternative meo loco is explained as = etsi meus dicendi est locus,
‘ though it is my turn to speak,’ and the analogy of νῦν δειξάτω
ἐν τῷ ἐμῷ ὕδατι (Dem. de Cor. ἓ 139) adds point to the reading :
Cicero gives the prosecutor and his counsel leave to interpose
a statement rebutting the assertion just made. But meo loco
should strictly mean ‘in my stead,' ‘ as a substitute for me 'z
pro Dom. ξ 82, ubi tu cavisti ne ‘meo me loco censor in senatum

loco for iu eo loco) does not seem to me to be at all convincing.
The passage in question is, Ita quaero abs te, 0. Eruci, quo
modo, et sic tecum aqam ut in eo loco (so all MSS.) vel respon-
dendi vel interpellandi tibi potestatem faciam, vel eciam, si quid
voles, interroqandi. In eo loco is here quite intelligible, and
really involves the other reading : if Erucius rose in his place,
