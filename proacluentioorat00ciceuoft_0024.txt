κ’( PRO A. C'LUENTIO.

with which Cluentius purchased Diogenes froin his
doctor, Cleophantus (ἓ 47) 3 it seems hardly enough to
say that the motive of the transference was quo facilius
aut comprehenderetur res eius indicio, aut falsa esse
coynosceretur. If Diogenes was a liar, the change of
ownership would have left him a liar still. The state-
ment that Fabricius had sought to corrupt Diogenes
(ss 47), and that the money found on Scamander was the
consideration which Diogenes was to receive for poisoning
Cluentius, rested ultimately on the bare word of a slave.
The only corroborative evidence which Cicero specifies in
support of his new version of the story is the deposition
of M. Baebius, and this he takes as matter of common
knowledge: qui qua fide, qua prudentia, qua diliqentia
faerit meminisse vos arbitror, ἓ 47.

The verdict brought in against Scamander, and also
that recorded against Fabricius soon afterwards, are
regarded by Cicero as constituting praeiudicia, or pre-
vious decisione, ‘prejudicing' the case of Oppianicus, with
the circumstances of whose trial we have next to deal.
It is an axiom with the orator that the guilt of
Oppianicus is involved in the conviction of those whom
he represents as having acted as his agents: cp. hoe
venenam Oppianici ἓ 62. But it should be noted that
the cases were not conducted on parallel lines. The
impeachment of Scamander and Fabricius was limited
exclusively to the charge of poisoning (g 62), and on that
count they were all but unanimously condemned—
Scamander with one dissentient, and Fabricius by a
unanimous verdict. In the case of Oppianicus many
other charges were included in the indictment (cp. ξ 19,
ξ 20, pauca . . . crimina, and ἓ 59); and his conviction
was secured by only the narrowest possible majority.
The composition of the majority vote that condemned
him must form the next subject of our inquiry3 mean-
