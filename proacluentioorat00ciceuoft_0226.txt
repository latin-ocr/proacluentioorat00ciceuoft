166 PRO Α. O'LUE'NTIO.

primo :primo actione (ἓ 55): so Verr. i. ξ 26, ozon primo
iudicare, opp. to ampliare. Cp. §106, where paulo posterius
patefacta re supplies an antithesis to primo. These jurors
wanted a further hearing, and then (as Cicero wishes his
hearers to infer) they would have voted ‘ Guiley!

non liquere dixerunt, ‘ held the charge not proven!
Dr. Reid founds on the use of dixerunt here and at ἓξ 106, 131
(cp. Gaea. §29) to prove that the NL verdict was given
orally and not in writing: see his note on pro Milone, ἓ 15.

qui hoc statuerunt, etc. Their view was that motivas
should be taken into account. Bulbus, Staienus, and Gutta
were supposed to have been bribed to vote against Oppianicus.
these severi homines saw in this no reason why, believing him to
be guilty, they should not vote according to their consciences.
They acted in fact, as Cicero says in 5106, stoa sponte non
Staieni fraude.

iudicabant. In ‘ reported thought ' we should have
expected iudicarent. Exception has been taken to statuerunt,
after possent ... vellent in the previous sentence, and with
putabant following. &acuerant suggests itself as an easy
emendation: cp. §134, where all codd. give consuerunt for
consueram.

superioribus suis iudiciis, ie, the verdicts against
Scamander and Fabricius.

Quinque omnino, ‘Five in all. ’ This solid fact should
be noted for the analysis of the voting. Itis probable that
Oppianicus was convicted by a majority of only one vote.
cp. on ἓ 106, and see Introd„ p. xxiii.

ambitione, ‘interested motivesss So ἓ 108, qui absolvit
ambitiosus,

ς ¹7¹7. homo maxime popularis, ‘ a thorough-going radical. ’

every breeze produced by town· talk and public maetingsss
Cp. the use of ventus, ἓ 131), and rumor, ἓ 131. So popularis
aura in Virgil and Horace.

invidia senatoria. The law-courts were at this time in
·the hands of the Senate: Introd, p. xxix.

contio, here a ‘ harangue ἐ so ἓ 127, ut illae Quinctianae
contiones habebantur. Cp. note on ξ 103.

t ,nulla esse iudicia, ‘trial by jury was a thing of the
pas .
