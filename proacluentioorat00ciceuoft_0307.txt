Senectute, and in the Tusculan Disputations‚ Book i., he states
the arguments of Plato on behalf of a future state3 and the
Somnium Scipionis (in de Repub. vi.) concludes with an
allusion to the rewards to be enjoyed after death by those
who have been faithful servants of their country in this life.
