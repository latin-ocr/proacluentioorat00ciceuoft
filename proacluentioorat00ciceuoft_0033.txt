INTRODUC'TION. xxix

Scamander, pronounced a judgment favourable to his
client Cluentius. In any case it should be remembered
that the present defence was conducted four years after
the compromise effected (in 13.c. 70) by the Lea? Aurelia,
which provided that the iudicia were to be composed
one-third of senators, another of equites, and another of
tribuni aeram'z'. At the trial of Scamander, in 13.c. 74, it
is probable that, as counsel for the accused, Cicero would
inveigh strongly against the senatorial resqz'me, especially
as the scandal of the marked voting-tablets (see on ἓ 130)
had, about the same time, given fresh proof of judicial
corruption in a way that must have strengthened the
hands of those who were beginning to agitate for the
restoration of their judicial privileges to the knights.
Cicero had always had at heart the interests of the
equestrian order, and hence his protest—the grounds for
which we must next consider——against a proceeding
which he alleged would render the niembers of that
order liable to the conspiracy clause in the Sixth Chapter
of the Lex Cornelia de Sicariis et Veneficz‘s, which was
teclmically applicable only to senators

After all that has been said, it may appear strange
that there should still remain for discussion the question
whether the alleged conduct of Cluentius at the trial of
the elder Oppianicus was really put forward as a count
in the present indictment against him. Nearly seven-
eighths of Cicero's speech are taken up with this aspect
of the case3 but it has been held that Cicero misrepre-
sented the indictment‚ and that the only charges directly
preferred against Cluentius were the charges of poisoning,
