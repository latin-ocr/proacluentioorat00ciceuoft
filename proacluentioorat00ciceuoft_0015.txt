of Cicero's client: of her he was said to have rid himself
by poison (ἓ 30). Then he murdered his own brother,
after having cleared the way for succeeding to his estate
by taking the life of his wife Auria, together with that
of her unborn child (ἓ 31). His second wife was Magia,
the daughter of a rich widow of Larinum named Dinaea ε
she died, after giving birth to a son who lived to be the
prosecutor in the present action (ξ 21). N ext Oppianicus
seems to have married Papia (ξ 27), who is probably
identical with the woman (a sister-in-law of Magia's)
whose unnatural guilt is recorded in 334, without any
mention of her name. His subsequent conduct seems
to have been motived by the desire to secure for her

made themselves obnoxious to him, including, among
others, Aurius Melinus‚ the husband of Sassia (ἓ 25).
Oppianicus is now free to pay his court to the rich
widow. He had divorced his third wife, Papia, whom
he had married under the discreditable circumstances re-

Oicero's narrative, he had rid himself also of a fourth
wife, Novia, who had lately borne him a son (filius
infans, ἓ 28). Sassia, for her part, was by no means
inconsolable over the loss of her husband, Melinus; she
only obJ’ected that her new suitor was burdened with
three children. Novia'srinfant child, and another boy
