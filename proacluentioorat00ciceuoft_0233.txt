N OTES. 173

sive, ‘ or if you like to put it this way.' This use of a
single sive is found also in Lucretius and Tacitus. It is
pretty common in Cicero : Sulla, ξ 17, erecto sive emisso.

istam dedit conciliationis et gratiae fabulam, ‘ trumped
up that story of compromise and reconciliation.' These words,
omitted in S'r, and also in one of the Palatine codd„ have
been rejected by most editors. But though they savour
distinctly of repetition, they are not of the stuff of which
adscripts are made. A verb of some kind seems to be
required after sive admonitus, and the phrase used here
suitably anticipates ξ 86, illud quod tum explosum acque
eiectum est. For dare fabulam, in this sense (instead of ‘to
put a farce upon the stage ') Dr. Reid compares Tusc. i. 3,
where the words are used of the author: he therefore
thinks that they “may well apply to him who brought the
present farce before the public, although he had borrowed
the idea.'' Conciliationis et qratiae has been attacked, Miiller
omitting the et, and Dr. Reid suggesting conciliatae 9ratiae:
but there is something contemptuous in the repetition of the
words used by Accius, which Cicero is, as it were, pillorying.

fama, ἓ 12. The recurrence of homines hominum hominem
is again noticeable ε cp. ἓ 79.

5 85. clam atque extra ordinem, ‘ secretly and irregularly.’

videtur voluisse, ‘ his object was, I presume.'

ἓ 69 adversarium, probably in the contest for the aedileship,

ἕ 86. cum re premeretur, lit. ‘being hard pressed by the
fact‚' tr. ‘in his desperate plight.’ With re (abl. instr.)
contrast cum faucibus premeretur, ἓ 84.

quodcumque diceret honestius diceret, really a con·

ditional sentence like quemcumque royaveris, hoc respondebit,
ἕ 90 : for the tense see on ἕ 80.

t explosum et eiectum est, ‘ was hissed and hooted off the
s age.

[qui cum matre 9] These words (omitted from the text)
are very probably an adscript, or rather the remains of an
adscript. There is no further reference to Sassia, and Cicero
goes on at once to speak of reus et accusator, which connects
immediately with cum Oppianico Cluentius. Sassia’s relentless
hatred might well occur to a copyist (if not to the speaker
himself at this point), as an obstacle to the reconciliation of
Cluentius with Oppianicus. But in any case the reading of STF
