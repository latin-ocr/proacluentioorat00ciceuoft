NOTES.

Ι, § 1. altera altera are undoubtedly nominatives.
Ramsay and Faussett agree in construing as ablatives, supply-
ing (ει-11361· Classen) ‘ accusator ’ as the subject of videbatur, on

Cluentius was instituted: two of the praetors-—Plaetorius
and Flaminius—dealing with charges of assassination (inter
sicarios, ἓ 147), while Q. Voconius Naso was responsible for
the working of that part of the statute which was directed
