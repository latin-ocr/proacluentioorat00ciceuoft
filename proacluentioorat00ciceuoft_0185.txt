NOTE'S. 1 25

patiatur, subjunctive because of the ‘subjective refer-
ence ’ involved, the charge being spoken of as it would present
itself to the minds of the jurors.

VII. 5 19. rationem accusationis is generally explained as
‘ the motive of the prosecution,' τὴν τοῦ ἀγῶνος προαίρεσιν.
But considering that causa accusandi occurs in the very next
line, it seems preferable to interpret ratio here as the method.
of the prosecution rather than the motive. The accuser had
to undertake a very wide indictment. cp. quam constanter
et quam diliyenter, ἓ 20, below.

1d ipsum. It was sheer necessity (vi ac necessitate) that
compelled Cluentius to prefer the charge, to say nothing] in the
meantime of his conduct of the prosecution—Quam constanter
et quamdiliqenter, postea dicam. See on ipsum nomen, ξ 12.

ξ 20. paravisset. The subjunctive is motived by the
preceding deprehendisset. It will be seen later that the
circumstances of the alleged attempt to poison Cluentius
are not so indubitable as Cicero would here have us
believe. See especially Introd. p. xviii.

non coniectura teneretur, ‘ did not depend upon
surmise‚' but was proved to demonstration ε it was matter of
‘ plain and palpable ' proof (oeulis ac manibus). For teneretur
cp. ἓ 97, quae res leye maiestatis tenebatur: also the frequent
use of contineri c. abl. Coniectura is from conicio (συμβάλλειν),
‘ to put two and two together': so ἓ 97.

diligenter, of the scrupulous care which Cluentius
bestowed on the indictment. It covered a great deal of
ground, and all that Cicero promises in the meantime is a
compendious statement (summatim exponam, ἓ 19) of the
crimina on which a conviction was secured.

capitis insidias, ‘intrigues against his very existence!
Vita and caput are often conjoined in this way: e.9. pro
Gaea, ἓ 63, Vim quae ad caput ac vitam pertineret 3 pro Mil„
ἓ 30. The technical application of the word ‘civil exist-
ence,' i.e. one’s rights as a citizen (see Ramsay's Roman
Antiquities, pp. 84-5), is also of frequent occurrence, e. 9. eapitis
periculum, ἓ 25 z cp. eapitis deminutio, capitis minor.

vitaret is the common reading. S. and Τ. have evitaret,
and this reading is adopted by Classen, Ramsay, and Faussett :
tr. ‘ might escape at once and for ever.'

pauca, i. e. only a few out of many.

diffidentem rebuS, ‘mistrusting his prospects.’ The
opposite is rebusque fidentes, Hor. Ο. iii. 5, 59 (Faussett).
