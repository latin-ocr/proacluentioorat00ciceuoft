xxii PRO A. CLUEN'I'IO.

The lot decreed that Staienus and two of his friends
should be the first to record their verdicts ; and as there
was a general suspicion that they had been bribed in
favour of the defendant, the surprise was great when all
three voted for a conviction. Some bewildered jurymen
began to believe that it must have been Cluentius who
had had recourse to bribery. The result was‘that, while
a considerable number held the charge ‘not proven,' five
actually voted for acquitta13 and it was only by a narrow
majority that Oppianicus was declared guilty.

How are we to account for the fact that the verdict
against Oppianicus was not unanimous, like that against
Fabricius, or all but unanimous, like that against
Scamander? His alleged attempt to bribe the bench of
jurors had entirely failed ι no one got any money from him
except Staienus, and even Staienus was forced eventually
to disgorge (ἓ 78). Those jurors whom Staienus had de-
luded with the promise of a bribe all voted against his
patron as soon as they found that the money was not
forthcoming. They returned what was, according to
Cicero, the right verdict, but they did so from pique and
disappointment. Surely if Oppianicus was, so notoriously
guilty, the jurors who had not been approached by
Staienus (some of them, presumably, honourable men),
would have given an adverse judgment instead of either
refusing to commit themselves or siding with the
minority.

The method by which Cicero endeavours to account for
the character· and composition of the verdict is obviously
another instance of ‘throwing <lustin the eyes of the jury.¹
His statement of the case is introduced by a glaring
sophism. Just as in the pro Milone he argues that,
either Milo waylaid Clodius with intent to murder him,
or Clodius waylaid Milo, so in the speech before us he
assumes that, as bribery had undoubtedly been practised‚
