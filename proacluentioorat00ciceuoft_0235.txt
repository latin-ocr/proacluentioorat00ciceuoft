the subjunctive here and the indicative in quo tempore...
licebat below: tr. ‘he was convicted even then, presiding
judge though he waS.’ Cp. ἓ 83.

iudex quaestionis: cp. quaesitor, ἓ 55, sometimes
quaesitor iudicii. He was not a magistrate in the sense that
he derived his authority from the people: certainly in the
quaestio de sicariis he was nominated by the praetor who
granted the trial. The office—practically a judgeship—
belonged to the regular circle of Roman magistracies (ἓ 148),
ranking somewhat below the praetorship. Cp. Brutus, 5264,
Is cum post curulem aedilitatem iudex quaestionis esset est
mortuus.

Non modo for non modo non, as §9‚ §68, §9:3. Tr. “ So
far was the tribune from allowing any grace in the action
that he did not even defer to the provisions of the 1aw.''

this sentence.

ξ 90. illa, attracted from illud: cp. on haec, §34. With
quaestio disceptatio iudicium, cp. Sest„ 540, nec mihi ille
iudicium populi nec le9itimam aliquam contentionem nec
disceptationem aut causae dictionem, sed vim, arma, exercitus,
imperatores, castra denuntiabat.

Putabo fuisse, i.e. ‘I shall suppose it was a fair trial,’

de illo populo. For this use of de, cp. ἓ 157, Quis de
plebe Romana?
