N OTES. 137

posse arbitrati sunt. In the case of verba sentiendi et
declarandi, when the subject of the infinitive is the same as
the subject of the princi al verb, it may be omitted, especi-
, ally if a personal or re exive pronoun. This usage occurs
most frequently with the fut. infin„ to which posse here is
practically equivalent. Cp. ἐξ 100, 176.

hos vestigiis consecutus est, ‘followed closely in their

track.' Vestiqiz's is a local abl„ like porta inyressus, recta ,

(sc. via) venire, etc. Cp. Brut. ἓ 90, Q. Hortensium ipsius
vestigyiis persecuti3 Liv. ix, 45, 16, pergyunt hostem vestiyiis
sequi. O'onsequi does not necessarily mean to ‘ overtake.'

longum est, ‘it would be a long business ' : cp. ξ 107,
and ‘ne louyum sic, ξ 198. In such expressions Latin prefers
the indicative to express as positive facts such abstract
relations as possibility, power, duty, convenience, and the
like. The English equivalent‚ on the other hand, implies
non-realization, as here, ie: would be tedious (Ι will not do it).
Nat. Deor. ii. ξ 159; Quint. x. l, 118.

exitum, πλε. ‘ how it all ended.'
5 3¹7. mulierculam, ‘ mistress,' contemptuous diminutive.

obsignatores ...auduom ‘brings witnesses to seal it.’ “A
man had his choice between two forms of making his will—
the civil form by mancipatio, and the praetorian, with seven
seals and seven witnesses, and without mancipatio '³ (Dia.
Antiq. av. TESTAMENTUM). ln the presence of the witnesses
the testator put his name to the document, and then they
subscribed their names and affixed their seals. This, at
least, was the usual form. In sealing, the witnesses would
use an anulus, or something that would make a mark on the
wax tablets (cp. yemma uda, Juv. i. 68), and in adding their
names (adscribere), they would say whose will it was they
sealed (cp. Asuvi nomine below). This was all done on the
outside of the tablets. “When sealed, it was deposited
with some friend, or in a temple, or with the Vestal Virgins 3
and after the testator's death it was opened (resigynare) in due
form'’ (Dice. Antiq. l.0.). Cp. Roby in Classical Beview, i., p. 69.

nossent, subjunctive after qui = tales qui. This was
their ‘ qualification.’

brevi fflo tempore, ‘ a short time after that ’ : cp. ξ 22, eis
diebus paucis, ξ 108.

hortulos, ‘ pleasure gardens,' or ‘ parks ' : as, for example,
the grounds of a country house. Cp. horti, Mil. ἓ 74.

harenarias, ‘saud-pits.' For the use of the adjective
as a substantive, cp. Cato, Oriy. vii. fig. 5 (p. 28, 6), sunt i‘n
