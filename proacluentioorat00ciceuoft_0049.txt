INTROD U ΟΤΙ ON. xlv

century there was in circulation a collection of variants,
taken from Transalpine sources, which gradually became
embodied in the Italian MSS, S being the most highly
corrected member of the family '² (p. xxxv). It follows
from this that where the better sources exist such codices
as S are of practically no importance “except in the
rare cases where they have preserved an original reading,
while the meliores are corrupt.'’

There is an obvious discrepancy between this view and
that which led Classen to rank S in a class by itself,
along with Τ and P, as one of the ‘codices praestantis·
simi' for the pro Cluentio. Did Classen go too far in
his preference for the recension embodied in S'rl as
against the sources from which the vulgate text had been
derived? Two points must be remembered. In the
first place, while it may be admitted that the existence
of better MSS. might have led to a still greater improve—
ment in the text, it is possible that S and Τ really
represent the vulgate, with corrections. In all probability
the original from which they are derived was one of a
class of MSS. which, like those on which Mr. Clark mainly
relies for his text of the pro Milone (Harleianua Teqern-
seensz's, and Erfurtensis), were corrected in the 9t1h or lOth

1The agreement between S and Τ is generally so complete that
they need hardly be treated separately for the purposes of this
discussion. In proof of the suggestion, made above, that the.
copyist of Τ was endeavouring to combine two recensione„ the
following places may be cited :—§ 6, 2ὶ sint PS, sint ω, om. Τ.;
ἓ 6, 23 peroraro tum PS, peroratum erit M, per ³⁶ ³⁶ tum Τ :'§ 24, 22
cum Maurius is P, cwm Aurius 2⁸3 S, cum A. Aurius ω, cum is Τ :
ἕ 135, 14 ob S, ad ω, ab T: ξ 139, 4 omnes enim illae S, omnes
enim illae orationes ω, omnes enim ¹1¹: ἓ 141, 3 et ex S, et PM, ex
¹1¹: ἓ 143, 18 imprudentes videlicet S, videlieet imprudentes ω,
videlicet Τ (here imprudentes was probably written in above the
line in the archetype): ἓ 143, 21 cui eqo S, eui eyo autem ω,
cui Τ.
