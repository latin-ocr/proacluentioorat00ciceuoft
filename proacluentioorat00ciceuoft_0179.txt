Pompeius Rufus.

ut tum habebatur. This phrase was inserted to pre-
pare the audience for what followed. The popular opinion of
Aurius Melinus afterwards changed considerably.

inter suos, ‘in his own community’ (domi suae), as

ain ξ 196, nobilitatem incer suos tuetur: in the text the use

οῗ the reffexive is unambiguous, though Melinus is not

formally the subject of the sentence. p.§ 23, domi nobilis.

In primis (imprimis) qualifies the adjectives· . cp. in Verr. ii.

§ 12. mulieris importunae, ‘an unnaturalwoman.’ Importu-
nus is an interesting word. ln its origin (in and portus, πό ρος), ’
it meant‘ hard of access,’ ‘unsuitabless ‘unfavourab1e²: its
opposite is opportunus. I't 1s commonly used in Cicero both
of things and persons (‘ unnaturaL' ‘monstrous' ) ε for its
application to Sassia, cp ἓ 177, crudelis alque importuna
mulier. So cle Fin. 1. ’ἓ 35 (of Manlius, who executed his own
son), nollem me ab eo ortum tam importuno tamque crudeli.

non solum dedecore, verum etiam scelere coniuncta, ‘in-
volving sin as well as dishonour. ' The ablative (without cum)
should be carefully noted; itis different from παρείας.. ,sceleris
societate coniunctae in ἓ 35, where the ablative is instru-
mental· : companionship 111 crime was the‘ bond of union' in
the alliance. An analogous use of the ablative occurs, Or.
§58, insiynis improbitas el scelere iuncta, though there it would
be easy to read sceleri: more crucial instances are Phil. iii.

§35andv. §20(cp. de Or. iii. §55).

umquam.. .audiet, immediately below. This 1s the reading of
the best MSS„ and seems appropriate to the context. Nominis
causa is also well supported, and gives a good sense with the
quo enim ipsum nomen clause following. Cicero says that he
will call Sassia a m‘other' for the sake os the name, i. e. to
excite horror 111 the breasts of his audience at her unmotherly
conduct. The intervening tametsi clause, how ever, seems to
be somewhat against nominis causa. —The omission of the
words in Quint Declam. 398 (Ritter, p. 441) suggests that
nominis cauea, may have been an adscript, emended into in
omni causa in the recension which 1s embodied in ΒΤ.

neque umquam ma ita audiet: lit.‘ nor shall she ever
so hear... as to forfeit‚' i. e. in my narrative she shall still retain
her natural title. Cf. bene, male audire: εὖ, κακῶς ἀκούειν.
