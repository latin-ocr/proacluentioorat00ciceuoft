this view, it is tempting to propose libuisset for licuisset: ‘ if the
censors had only cared to give Habitus the same chance.'

If Habito were not in construction with licuisset (instead
of, as Dr. Reid suggests, with facere), Cicero would probably
have emphasised the subject in the next clause, facile is illis
ipsis iudicibus. On the whole it is best to acquiesce in the
traditional explanation, especially as Cicero is purposely vague.

censores de ceteris subscriperunt), is to the cases with which
the orator has been dealing, the censure, namely, of Aquilius,
Gutta, Popilius, and Cluentius.

censoria subscriptione, ablativa of attendant circum-
stance, lit. ‘with a censorial endorsement,' a censor-like
notification of the why and wherefore of his action. The
reference is to the clause quoted from the will, quod is ob
Oppianici condemnationem pecuniam accepisset.

The alternative is to take subscriptione as a causal ablative,
and to understand it as referring to the actual notification of
the censors. For the constr. Dr. Reid cites de Le9. iii. ἓ 15;

But it does not appear from the context that the censors
actually censured the younger Egnatius for his conduct at the
trial ; cp. in senatu...retinuernnc. On the contrary the whole
incident is used by Cicero as a transition from the action of
the censors to that of the senate. Accius had cited the fact
that Egnatius, senior, had disinherited his son on the ground
of his conduct at the trial of Oppianicus. Cicero at once
rejoins with a dilemma. His opponent, he says, cannot claim
