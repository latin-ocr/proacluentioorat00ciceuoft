N OTES. 213

probatum erat illud. The construction is the usual
probare causam alicui, as s 102. Cp. 577, iudicia minus iam
probari populo arbitrabatur, and see on 552. Illud: the
view that was set before the mob at its contione-s. The
vague use of the demonstrative might be held to favour the
retention of the words α tribuno seditioso in the preceding
line: they also give more point to contra dicere in what
follows. But here again it is difficult to disregard the authority
of tr, and to accept these words as part of the original text:
it is at least equally probable that they are a later addition.

multitudini: nemim licitum. This reading, originally
conjectured by Antonius Augustinus, was afterwards found
in the Turin palimpsest: other MSS. give multitudinem
inlicitum. In the archetype the words would appear thus—
ΜῠιΤῙΤυῡΙΝῙΝΕΜῙΝῙΠοΙΤσΜε the repetition of the syllable
IN caught the eye of some scribe, who wrote multitudinem
inilicitum, afterwards corrected to multitudinem inlicitum,
“a combination perfectly satisfactory as far as the mere

words are concemed, but destitute of sense ’' (Ramsay,
Introd. adfim).

laborabat, ‘ put himself about to.’
illa iudicia. See on illa iudicia senatoria, § 61.

paucis postea mensibus, i. e. a few months subsequent to
the trial of Oppianicus, after which Quinctius had at once
begun his agitation (ἓ 74). No one has proposed to alter
postea to antea, though the date given for the incident referred
to is B.c. 75, the year previous to the iudicium Iunianum. At
the trial of his kinsman Terentius Varro, Cicero’s rival
Hortensius had bribed the jurors, and, in order to make sure
that they had kept their contract with him, had caused the
voting tablets (tabellae) to be marked ln a peculiar way (Div.
in Caecil. §24. in V err i. 540).

alia vehemens erat. ,invidia versata, etc., the jury-
courts‘ had been the scene ‘of another grave scandal.’

macula iudiciorum: cp. macula familiae §12

nominee, accusative: resumed by eos. The particular
reference here is to Aquilius and Gutta. In his speech
against Verres (i. ἐξ 39, 40) Cicero conjoins the conduct of the
jurors at the trial of Oppianicus and the scandal of the marked
voting-tablets in his invective against the senatorial jury-
cour-ts.

fflo ipso tempore, illis censoribus, i. e. in Β. c. 70, the
date of the Lex Aurelia, and also of the censorship of
Lentulus and Gellius.
