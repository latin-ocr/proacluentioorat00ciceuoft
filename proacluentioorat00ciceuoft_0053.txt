-INTROD UOTJON. xlix*

ω ; ξ 119, 25 exempli causa ponam ΒΤ, exemplu} ponam ω
(see note ad loc.) : ξ 125, 24 abortione S, potione ω : ἓ 174,
3 casum minime, etc„ sm, mortem satis, etc„ ω.1 Even a
reading like fuit receuti quam, ἓ 36, 22, might be defended
as possibly the original tradition. The authority of P is
against the supposition3 but if we might suppose that
receuti stands, by a kind of haplography‚ for re
recenti, the text might well enough run, quam clara
fuit re recenti, quam omnium sermone celebrata! (cp. on A.
Aurius, ἓ 23, 11; so ἓ 95, 25, and especially ἓ 147, 3
reliquae-stiones P,2 for retiquae quaestiones: also ἓ 140, 13,

quasi ω for quasi si ΒΤ).

Tbere is also the evidence of the ‘transposition
variants,’ which goes, on the whole, to show that the
εἰ* version is to be preferred as more probably repre-
senting the collocat-ion of Cicera-⁹⁵ A list could be made

except in cases where the use of an unsyncopated form would lend
itself to some favourite rhythm: cp. ἓ 117, 22 observarunt STM,
observaverunt F, with ξ 125, 19 and 22 curaverit s'r, curavit ΕΜ,
and ibid. 22 necaverit.

1 It my help to explain the substitution of wwrtem for caswm if
1 record the fact that in one of the mss. I examined in London
(Harl. 5428) an omission has been made of a few lines at this
place. The reading given is propter multorum eiusmodi [cas m
minime . . . id ut intellegatis et] mortem eius, etc. If this is not
a merely accidental omission, caused by the recurrence of mortem
in the vulgate, it may point to an earlier dislocation of the text.

2It has been supposed (see cr. note on Quint. x. 1, 44) that in
some uss. syllables that were to be repeated in sequence were
distinguished by letters of a larger size: this would explain the
origin of the corruption in ἓ 130, 1, where the archetype may have
had multitudINemini licitum: P rightly gives multitudini ‘nemini
licitum, but the vulgate misinterprets multitudinem illicitum (cp.
Ramsay‚ Introd. ad fim).

³Copyists seem often to have exercised their ingenuity on the
order of words. Thus we have, ἓ 27, 10, Mater misera nihil mali
suspicans mittit s'l', which seems to have been changed in the
