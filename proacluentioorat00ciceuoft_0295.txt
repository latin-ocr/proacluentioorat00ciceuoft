N OTES. 235

making a direct appeal to the knights (as one of the three
zzcggigegrtlzanhich the J‘urors belonged) ε cp. ἓ 152, auctoritatem

non fecerunt idem ut putarent. For the constr. cp.
ᾖ 137, J'actum est ut id non arbitrarentur : and see also on
ἓ 150, quis hoc accusavit ut se putaret.

repugnarunt cum haec recusarent et palam dicerent
Repuynarunt cum dicerent is a very usual construction, ‘ they
resisted, saying ' : commentators have found greater difficulty
in explaining cum haec recusarent et dicerent. We might
translate ‘they resisted, protestin9 aqainst these proposals
and saying': but haec is not quite clear, and the phrase is
suspicious occurring as it does immediately after recusando,
used absolutely. Madvig (followed by Miiller) makes the
simple change to reputarent, on which reading Ilaec anticipates
se potuisse, etc. Dr. Reid proposes refutarent: haec would
then: ‘arguments such as Accius has used.' It is simplest
to adhere to the text, and to explain recusare of ‘raising a
legal plea,’ as in ἓ 156 : cp. ἓ 154 non hoc recusabant ne, etc.

potuisse: see on ἓ 133, where in direct statement the
verb would have been potuit, as here potuimus. Faussett com-
pares Juvenal x. 123, Antoni potuit yladios contemnere si sic
Omnia dixisset.

splendor, ‘ prestige, ‘ distinction ἐ see on ξ 46, and cp.
domi splendor, ἓ 154.

ornamenta, ‘ distinctions‚' as honorum ornamenta, ἓ 154,
below. Cp. ἐξ 120, 132, and the enumeration following, locus,
auctoritas, etc.

quae se non contempsisse. Quae here = et ea, the in-
finitive following, in oratio obliqua, the relative introducing a
‹zo-ordinate clause.

invidiarum: an instance of the use of an abstract noun in
the plural (with reference to individual cases).

huiuscemodi iudiciorum. After iudiciorum, the editio
princeps and others insert anfractu, a word which seems to
be without any MS. authority. But an ablative of some sort
(periculis ?) may have fallen out, or else huiuscemodi iudici-
orum may be an adscript, based on huiuscemodi iudicia, ἓ 152,
huiuscemodi quaestionibus, ἕ 153.

§⁸ 1⁵4. aetatem integram, lit. ‘unimpaired age,’ i.e. the
period of life when all is young and fresh.

non posset, sc. fieri. Cp. ad Fam. i. 2, 4, nos dianitatem
ut potest retinebimus. So in comedy, ess. Plaut. Merc. 779,
Potin' ut molestus ne sis?
