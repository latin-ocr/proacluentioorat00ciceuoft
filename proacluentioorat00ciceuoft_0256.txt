196 PRO A. CLUENTIO.

- Quamquam. ‘And yet ἰ used like etsi to introduce a
limitation. mihi: ethic dative, as ἓ 97.

ambitus: gen. of the charge, as at ἐξ 32, 97. Ambitus
may be rendered ‘ corrupt practices at an election,’ and was
specially applicable to bribery when resorted to for the pur-
pose of gaining office ε cp. on ἓ 98, from which it will appear
that the statute under which a charge of corruption ob rem
iudicandam would properly be brought (propria leqe huius
peccati) was either the statute De Repetundis (Lex Servitia,
Lex Cornelia) or the Lem Cornelia de Sicariis.

ἓ 115. hoc istius criminis hac plaga all refer to the
charge of having taken a bribe to vote for the conviction of
Oppianicus.

Ρ. Septimio Scaevolae litem eo nomine esse aestim-
atam: lit. ‘that a penalty was assessed for P. Septimius
Scaevola on that account: πλε. that a separate charge
was made under this head (eo nomine, cp. on ξ 99) in
assessing the amount he was to refund. The litis aestimatio
was the supplementary process which followed on convictiou
in the case of certain crimes where the punishment might be
graduated according to the degree of crimfflality, e.,q. em-
bezzlement or extortion. By this process was determined the
amount a defendant had to pay in name of damages, on what
score each sum was to be exacted, and to whom it was due.
Matters might be brou ht up at a litis aestimatio, which
formed no part of the in ictment preferred at the trial which
had resulted in the defendant's convicti0n3 and the entries
thus made might form the subject of investigation before
another quaesitost Moreover other persons besides the accused
might be incriminated, and might afterwards be brought to
trial on the charge referred to in the ‘ assessment of penalty,'
e.9. those who had been guilty of receiving misappropriated
moneys, ad quos pervenisse pecunias in litibus aestimandis
statutum sit, ξ 116.

The other side had cited the litis aestimatio in the case here
referred to as having the binding force of a previous legal
decision (iudicium—praeiudicium). Cicero does not dispute
the statement that the court took Scaevola’s alleged misconduct
at the trial of Oppianicus into account in assessing the penalty
fixed in his case (litem eo nomine esse aestimatam), though
this alleged misconduct had formed no part of the indictment

lcp. ΡΒ. Asconius on Verr. Act. i. 39, qui ambo peculatus damnati sunt.
Quid hoc, inquiet quispiam, ad iudicium corruptum pertinet? Re-
spondebimus, litis aestimationem [fieri] non solum ex titulo propositi
criminis, sed etiam ex aliis probationibus, quae ex ante actis rebus apud
iudices constiterint. Hi, peculatus crimine prosposito‚ etiam quas
iudicando pecunias ceperant reddiderunt.—-H.N.
