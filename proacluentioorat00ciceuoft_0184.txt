124 PRO A. CLUE'NTIO.

infamiamque esse conflatam: ἓ 95, ς 169. Many MSS. have
perfectum ε with profectum the prep. a: ‘ from,’ not ‘ by.’

‘3³ sic agitur ut, ‘ the case is such that,' ‘the issues are 80 '
grave that,' etc. The reading in the text seems on. the whole
to be preferable to the alternative, Sed ea vero sic ayit ut.
The contractions used for aqit and aqitur are very similar
in form, and the pronoun was inserted by a scribe who had
mistaken the one for the other.

reticeri, impersonal as ξ 17, de turpitudine parentis dici
vix oportere. Many codd. give reticere3 but in the following
passages also the question should probably be settled in
favour of the passive form, as being more idiomatic: ξ 44,
removeri3 ἓ 73, pronuntiari; § 122, appellari (where 866
11016); ibid. moveri ; §13:3, existimari: cp. however §36,
inire ; §² 162, debere.

periculum here of peril 01· jeopardy resulting from an
action-at-law. Op. hominum pericula above ; si hominum
periculis non defuissem, ἓ 51 ; also ἓξ 81, 117, 157. Similarly
salus is often (e.9. ἓ 3) used of deliverance from such peril,
i. e. ‘ acquittal.'
illa accusatio. It has been proposed to excise accusatio.
Perhaps rather insert (with Dr. Reid) et before omnis testium
c‘'Im'‘instituit accusatores, instruit testes, ‘ she organizes the
prosecution and marshals the evidence.'

squalore huius et sordibus, ‘ the defendant's neglected
person and shabby apparel.’ Cluentius was sordidatus, i. e. he
put on his worst clothes, as was customary at Rome, in the hope
of moving the compassion of the bench: cp. pro Mur. ἐξ 42, 86.

temere appellari, lit. ‘ that she is being recklessly
named,' or ‘brought into the case,’ i.e. that this is a random
attack upon her: For this use of appellare cp. §65, Te,
Oppianice, appello, te, T. Atti: §148 Ramsay cites de
Off i. ἓ 89, ne alii plectantur alii ne appellentur quidem
(challenged). The word is frequent also with adverbs, and in
the phrase aliquem honoris causa appellare, i.e. to make a
complimentary reference to a person. For a different use of
appellare (‘ to make overtures to ’ ), see ἐξ 71, 194.

temere seems to be used with reference to its etymo-
logical meaning, ‘in the dark,’ ‘blindly ': cp. perspexeritis,
aperta, in the immediate context. The stem reappears in
our English ‘dim' (A.-S. thimm) ; it is found also (with a
somewhat unaccountable change from m to n) in tenebrae (i.e.
temebme, *temsraa medial ‘—sr-' in Latin always becoming
‘ -br-,' as in sobrinus from *sves-rinos.
