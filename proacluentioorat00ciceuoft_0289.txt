condemnaretur. The present subjunctive would have
been more usual; but, as Mr. Faussett says, “the thought

Quid interest. The direct question in the indicative,
with the reply Etsi esc apertum, etc.‚ seems much more appro-
priate to the context than the generally received Quid in-
tersit lex nos docet. What does it matter, the orator asks,
whether the statute is in general terms or with a limitation
of persons? The reply is “The difference is obvious, and,
moreover, the statute shows it on its very face.”

sua interesse. “No satisfactory explanation has been
given of this construction. One view is that mea refert was
originally [ex] mea refert (like ex mea re est), ‘it is to my ad—
vantage,' and that ex was lost. Interest having much the
same force, but being later in development, took the construc-
tions of refert by false analogy.’' Gildersleeve-Lodye, 381. 5.
Cp. Roby, 1285: Wo‘lfflin. Archiv. ii. 213.

liae facultate defensionis, i.e. ‘my abilities as an advo-
