xvi PRO A. CL UENTIO.

‘infer that the convict was by no means so badly off as
Cicero makes out. In particular, we may note that his
own and Sassia's friends, who are described as homines
honesti atque omnibus rebus ornati (ἓ 176),”ἰηῖεεῐ·εεῡθά them-

The facts of the death of Oppianicus, as referred to by
Cicero, seem open to doubt: it will not escape a critical
reader, for instance, that while secking to disprove the
genuineness of the alleged depositions of Strato and
Nicostratus, he nowhere definitely states what those
depositions were.

The two minor charges of poisoning alleged against
Cluentius need not detain us. The first Cicero refutes
on the evidence of the senator Plaetorius, with whom the
alleged vic'tim, Vibius CappadOX, was staying at the time

forward the father of the young Balbutius, who was
said to have met his death by accidentally swallowing

‚ a poisoned draught which Cluentius was alleged to have
prepared for Oppianicus the younger (ἓὲ 166-168). This
last may, perhaps, be considered the only satisfactory
piece of evidence in the whole speech. For the rest,
Cicero seems to have had ample reason for his boast, as
reported by Quintilian z se tenebras offudisse iudiczbus in
causa Cluenti ιᾳῖονίοιιαε est, Inst. ii. 17. 21.

THE SCAMANDER INcmENT.

The conviction of Scamander, the freedman of the
Fabricii, formed one of the praeiudicia or ‘previous
decisions' recorded against Oppianicus, on which Cicero
largely relied for the success of his present defence.
When Scamander was prosecuted for having been a party
to the alleged attempt on the life of Cluentius, Cicero
had appeared on his behalf3 and one of his main
difficulties in defending Cluentius now was that he had
