NOTES. 185

reperietur. For the future, cp. tenebitur, ς 125.

XXXVII. ς 103. Ergo adhuc...v1deo, ‘So far, then, I
find? etc. For a similar collocation, cp. de Prov. Gons. ξ 42,
Erqo adhuc mayis est mihi verendum ne pro Mil. §52
Video constare adhuc, iudices, omnia. In the latter passa e
video is followed lower down by videamus, as here the wor s
Videamus ecquod atiud iudicium proferre possimus resume
Erqo adhuc video, with the intention of carrying the
argument a stage further. See also pro Rosc. ἓξ 92, 95.

appellet necesse est. The apodosis here, in the
indicative, makes the assertion of the necessity of denying
any connection between the trial of J unius and that of
Cluentius independently of the condition.

Illud Iunianum (sc. iudicium), ‘ the trial of ,J unius ἰ
elsewhere (6.9. ἓ 1) of the trial of Oppianicus before J unius.

c. Fidiculanius Falcula. For a discussion of this case
(of which Cicero gives a quite different account in pro
Caecina, ἓξ 28-9), see Intro. p. xxv.

cum praesertim with condemnarat (not dixin: ‘ though
indeed‚' ‘and that although.' In such a context this phrase
comes to have the force of quamvis, or idque cum tamen: see
my note on Quint. x, 1, ἓ 105.

ex subsortitione, ‘ as a substitute ἐ see on ξ 91.

contionibus seditiosis et turbulentis, ‘ factious and
violent harangues.' So turbulenta contio, ad Att. iv. 3, 4:
cp. Quint. v, 13, 39, Presserat enim turbulentis contionibus
Cluentium Quinctius. Mr. Faussett takes contiones here of
‘meetings ’ (as ἓξ 2, 93, 95), and that certainly is the meaning
in four other passages of this speech where turbulenta contio
occurs. But the alternative meaning seems more appropriate
here: cp. 577, contio vehemens et qravis 3 §122 ut illae
Quinctianae contiones habebantur.

non suae decuriae munere, lit. ‘ by the duty not of his own
decury ’ or ‘ section,’ i.e. ‘ when the duty did not devolve on
the panel to which he belonged.' For the exercise of their
judicial functions the senators (who had enjoyed a monopoly
of the iudicia from B.c. 81 to B.c. 70) seem to have been
divided into as many decuries as there were quaestiones, and
one decury may have been annually assigned to each quaestio.
When from any reason a place or places on the bench became
vacant, a subsortitio had to be made (from the decury proper
to the quaestio) by the iudex quaestionis, on showing cause for
so doing to the city praetor, and then it was open to any one
interested to make objections. In this particular case the
