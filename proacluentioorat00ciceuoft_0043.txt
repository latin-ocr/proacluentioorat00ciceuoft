gone so far in misrepresentation as this theory assumes.
Let us look again at the explicit statemeuts which he
makes: A. Cluentius causam dicit eques Romanus ea leffe
qua senatores et ei qui mam-stratum habuerunt soli tenentur,
ἓ 156; cp. ἓ 148, where the sections of the statute
quoted are seen to apply only to senators, official and
unofficial (qui mayz'stratum habuerint, quive in senatu sen-
tent-iam dixerint). The orator has already disclaimed all
intention of sheltering himself behind the letter of the
statute (gg 143-145), but he does not disdain to take
advantage incidentally of the argument which he appears
to renounce. Cp. ἓ 145, quod si nihil aliud esset actum
nisi ut home causam obtineremus, Zeye recitata peropassem :
ἐξ 148, 157, and note on ἓ 154.

On the whole, therefore, it seems to be safest to adhere

to the view that Cluentius was impeached under the Fifth ’

Chapter of the Cornelian LaW, which related to poisoning,
and also under the Sixth. Though the prosecution
nominally relied on the direct charges brought under the
former head, its real strength lay in an elastic construc-
tion of the provisions of the Sixth Chapter, especially in

view of the strongly prevailing belief that Cluentius had
used corrupt means to procure the conviction of his step-

father eight years before.
It has been already said that Cicero⁷s boast, reported
by Quintilian, that he had “thrown dust in the eyes of

the jurymen at the trial of CluentiUS‚'’ makes it probable
that his client was acquitted. The charges of poisomng
alleged against Cluentius seem to have had little ground
of support. But we have seen that there are grave
reasons for doubting the accuracy of Cicero's statements
in regard to the conduct of Cluentius at the trial of
Oppianicus. The probability rather is that “there was
bribery on both sides, and Cluentius was able to bribe
the odd man.'’ And suspicion has been shown to attach
