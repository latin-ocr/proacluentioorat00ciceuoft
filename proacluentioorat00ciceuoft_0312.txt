252 PRO A. CLUENTIO.

Ea procedere: this acc. o. inf. depende on fureret
Sassia is ‘beside herself with rage at the utter miscarriage of
her designs.’ Cp. ad Qu. Fr. ii. 1. 3, furebat se a Racilio
contumaciter inurbaneque vexatum. Procedere is common in
the sense of ‘turning out well‚' or as we say colloquially
“coming off'': cp. προχωρεῖν.

011111 iam tortor atque essent tormenta ipsa defessa.
Nagelsbath, p. 638, points out the latent chiasmus 11010· -

{um iam tortor esset atque essent tormenta ipsa defessa. See
1s instances.

constitutum est satis videri· ‘it was unanimously resolved
that, in the opinion of the witnesses, the inquiry had gone
far enough) Videri (as again in ἓ 182) gives the actual
wording of the verdict: cp. in Verr. 5, ξ lg4‚ Fecisse videri
pronuntiavit, ‘he deelared him guilty‘ 111 ’his opinion.'

δ 178. Larinum. We learn from ἓ 184 that the in-
vestigation took place at Rome.

ad quem perveniret = cum ad eum perveniret.
non modo sed ne quidem: see on ξ 9.

importuna : see on ἓ 12.

quae simulasset ε ‘ though she had pretended.’
instructam et ornatam : ‘ furnished and stocked.’

LXIV. velle atquesoptare: ‘ready and eager.’ Dr. Reid says
that optare is not ‘to set one's heart on a thing' (Faussett),
but to desire something which one can only obtain by great
good fortune. The difference between this and struere et
moliri, where the clement of personal exertion comes in, is
obvious. The process of velle atque optare can go on, as it
were, in an arm-chair. Cp. ξ 188, voluerit, optaverit,
amicaverit, effecerit.

ξ 179. Q. Hortensio Q. Metello consulibus, i.e. in nc. ³79.
We may infer from this that the death of Oppianicus took
place in Β.0. 72, two years after his eonviotion. In the text
Q. was inserted before Hortensio by Orelli.

aliud agentem, tr. ‘ when he was quite indifferent,' and
when nothing was further from his thoughts z see on ἕ 155.

ex genero, ate. by A. Aurius Melinus.

posset is not the reading of the MSS„ which give possit:
this would have to be explained on the principle of ‘vivid-
ness.

Strato ille medicus : “ Doctor Strato.’'
nummorum auri: ‘ coin bullion.'
