xlii PRO A. CLUENTJO.

characterization of it which will follow later on, Ι may
quote here what is said of it by O. F. W. Miiller: “In
Fonteiana aliisque prae melioribus recte spernitur, in
Cluentiana fere optumus est ’' (Cicero, Pars ii., vol. ii.‚
p. ow). “

Τ, the Codex Laurentianus, xlviii. 12, in the Laurentian
Library at Florence. This is one of the numerous Mss.
collated by the J esuit Father Girolamo Lagomarsini
(1698-1773), whence it is known as Lagomarsinianus 12.
It is closely allied to s, the agreement between the two
being generally so complete that we must believe them to
be derived from the same archetype. We shall find that
such differences as exist go to show that the copyist of Τ
was endeavouring to combine two recensions.

b, the Codex S. Marci, n. 106, Lagom. 6. The corrections
in this Ms. (b2) are of special importance, as they represent
the recension embodied in s and Τ.

F, described by Classen as ‘codex olim bibliothecae S.
Bartholomaei Faesulis, inter Faesulanos apud Bandinium
n. 187, Lagom. 1, membranaceus, seculi quinti decimi . . .
lacunarum immunis.' What these lacunae are will
appear from the following paragraph.

M, ‘Laurentianus plut. li., 11. 10, Lagom. 64, mem-
branaceus sec. undecimi, characteribus Langobardicis,
form. 4’ (Classen). It should be noted that the Cluentius
is the only speech of Cicero which this codex contains:
the rest of it is made up of Varro's de linqua Latina
and the Rhetorica ad Herennium. This may be taken as
some evidence that the speech had been singled out
for special attention. It is probable that we have in
Μ the original of all the codices in which the same
lacunae appear, viz. those which extend in many MSS.
