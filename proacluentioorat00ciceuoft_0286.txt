beiny as sinewsss etc.: i.e. the partes are to the civitas what
nervi, sanquis, membra are to the corpus. Hartman proposed
to delete these words, but they occur in Quint. v. 11, 95.

Legum ministri magistratus (sc. sunt). ‘ The law has
its ministers in our magistrates) The use of servi sumus in
what follows may have reminded Cicero’s hearers 01 the
etymological meaning of the words minister, maslister z it is as
though he had said, ‘ Those who are over us (may-i3)a1·e under
(min-us) the laws.'

interpretes, ‘ spokesmen. ’

legum servi sumus. It is very difficult to choose
between the two readings here, but in spite of the authority
of P. (which gives legib. n1q. idcirco omnes servimus) I am
inclined to think that Zeyum servi sumus is right. The
triple repetition 01 layum is effective, and for servi sumus, as

scribae and lictores, Cicero employs a collective designation

which reminds us that Apparitores was the general name ⁶

101· the public officers attached to the service 01 the magis-
trates at Rome. In addition to scribae and lictores, there were
accensi, viatores, and praecones.

quasi mente quadam legis, ‘by what I may call an
intelligent force, namely the law.' Leyis seems to be a
genitive 01 definition or material: cp. Eur. Hec. 65, σκίπωνι
χερός, ‘ the staff which 18 thine arm.' Dr. Reid, 011 the other
hand, takes lessi-s as a genitive 01 possession, and would render
‘by the intellectual force, if I may so call it, 01 the law':

quasi quadam being the apology, as it were, for the unusual
expression mens ἱερέες.

Quid inter sicarios, ‘ What about the court for cases
of assassination ¹? ' For inter sicarios see Introd. p. xxx. note.

So numerous were the cases that came before this quaestio “

that the praetor assigned to it had the co·operation of the
three iudices quaestionis named in this section-Naso,
Plaetorius, and Flaminius.
