third party (Livy, xxxix, 42. 7)¹, and the defence which was
permittcd to the accused (Plut. Ο. οναοο1ι., 2), it differed
from it in the fact that there were no fixed rules of procedure
for conducting the case” (Dici. Aut„ s.V. Infamia). It was
in fact not a iudicium but an animadversio.

often in inscriptions, formed one decuria, presided over by

cum defendissem. This was probably a case of re-
appointment. Cicero advocated the claim of Matrinius,
whose clerkship was endangered by the stigma that had been
affixed to his name by the censors of the year Β. c. 70.

aerarium reliquissent. I accept here the traditional
reading against reliquisse subscripserunt (ΤΕ) reliquisse scrip-
serunt (S). To say nothing of the minor difficulty caused by
the omission of se (harsher here than, e.9. at ξ 100, where
accepisse is repeated from the previous clause), subscripserunt,
occurs in its proper sense (subscriptio, ξ 118) only three lines
below, and may easily have got out of position here, if indeed
it was not introduced from the margin. As to aerarium
relinquere, if this were the only passage in which the phrase
occurred, we should undoubtedly interpret it as meaning to
leave a man in the class to which previous censors had
degraded him, i.e. to confirm and continue the stigma upon
him. But in a parallel passage in Livy the same phrase
occurs in reference to cases where there is no question of
degradation by previous censors: exitu censurae, cum in lenes
iurasset G‘. Claudius, iuter ‘nomina eorum quos aerarios relin-
quebat dedit colleqae nomen (xxix. 37). Here the expression
is appropriate to the action of Claudius who, at the close of
his term of office, confirmed a pronouncement which he had
himself made against his colleague: but when we find the
same phrase used of the wholesale disfranchisement of the
thirty-four tribes by Livius, we are forced to conclude that it
means little more than in aerarios referre, though used
rather in regard to the effect of the action of the censors than
to the action itself : Deinde M. Livius quattuor et xxx tribus
