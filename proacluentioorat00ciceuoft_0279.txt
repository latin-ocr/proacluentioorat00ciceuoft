N O'J‘ES. 219

anno post, υἷε. within a year from that date.

in quos, lit. ‘looking to whom,’ or ‘for whose time of
office.' The resolution was doubtless so worded that if the
consuls for the year did not act upon it, it would devolve upon
the consuls-elect to take it up on entering office.

neque id confirmas, ‘ without backing your statement
gyissghe merest shred of suspicion.' Cp. pertenuis suspicio,

primum followed by ipse deinde populus. Ι print the
whole as one sentence.

quod tu arguis, ‘ with regard to your allegation.'

factum est ut id non arbitrarentur. Cp. §s 153, ‘non
jecerunt idem...ut putarent, and see on ἓ 168. The repetition
of id in ut id quod id postea seems rather harsh‚ in spite of
hunc locum eum, ἓ 7, and hoc quod id eyo, ἓ 17 ; the text
would run more smoothly ut quod senatus· decreverat...id. Tr.
“They did not feel under any obligation, in fact, to submit at
a later stage to the people, etc.’'

ad illud. invidiae praesens incendium restinguendum,
‘with a view to quench the flames of that momentary out-

legislation on the subJect had previously been made to the
people, which is not the case. Some action on the part of the
senate had been called for at exciting public meetings (rem
illam et royatz'onem flaqitarat); but nothing short of the formal
introduction of a lex on the subject before the comitia by a
tribune would seem to justify the use of referre ad populum
in this context.—In § 20 ΒΤ give retineretur for teneretur, and
other places might be cited where the prefix is either wrongly
inserted or wrongly omitted (sm ‘nuntiant 524, against P and
ω renuntiant).

c. Iunii. For the circumstances of his trial see ἓξ 89-96.
J unius’s little boy may have been brought on the platform at
some contio. For lacrimis commoveri, cp. Mil. ξ 101.

maximo clamore et concursu, ie. they ‘ran together
with great uproar' to disown the whole affair.

§ 1³8. intellegi potuit, i.e. ‘any one could have seen.’
