rescindat. No actual veto was required for this; it
was enough if either of the two censors withheld his active
concurrence and support.

in aerarios referri, ‘ to disfranchise.' The aerarii were
a class of citizens who were originally excluded from the
tribes, and paid only a poll-tax (aera pendebant), not a tributum
on landed property. Appius Claudius Caecus, censor B.c.
312, admitted them into the tribes, along with the freedmen ;
the censorin 304 restricted them to the four tribus rusticae
(which afterwards included also the freedmen as well as the
capite censi).' While the aerarii were excluded from the
tribes they had no ius suffrayii, and probably no ius honorum.
During this period, therefore, the effect of in aerarios referre
was complete disfranchisement. Later the phrase indicates
not loss of tribe but transference: the censors might degrade
a man b y changing him from a rural to one of the city tribes,
the members of which constituted a lower class, taxed on
their personalty instead of 011 land, but possessing of course
the ius suffragyii and the ius honorum. Mr. Faussett thinks
that the active infinitives referre and movere are more
probable (after movere velit) than referri, moveri (cp. on
appellari, above), and would supply an accusative subject,
such as scribas. This somehow seems, however, more difficult
with vetet than with iubeat. The censor was said tribu
movere, and he would not therefore be said tribu movere
iubere, or vetare.

The use of aut instead of et (as usually in Livy, ay. iv· 24,
73 xxiv. 43, 33 xlii. 10, 4; xliv. 16, 83 xlv. 15, 8) shows
that Cicero has two alternative processes in mind. The first
(in aerarios referre) amounts to complete disfranchisement, such
as naturally took place in the days when the aerarii were
outside the tribes, and might, in extreme cases, be decreed
even afterwards: Livy, xlii. 10, 4, quoted above, aerarios
fecerunt et tribu moverunt. The second process (tribu movere)
means removal from the country to the less reputable city
tribes, a minor form of disqualification: Livy, xlv. 15, 4, Neque
enim si tribu movere possit, quod 3ἰύ nihil aliud quam mutare
iubere tribum, ideo omnibus quinque et triyinca tributus emovere
posse, id esc civitatem libertatemque eripere. (In itself tribu
movere might refer to either process: contrast Livy, xlii.
10, 4with xlv, 15, 8. But a distinction is obviously intended
by the context here.)
