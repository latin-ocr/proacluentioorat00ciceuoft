xl PRO A. CLUENTIO.

also to Oicero's account of some of the incidents which
preceded and led up to the trial of Oppianicus,——notably
the alleged attempt to poison Cluentius, and the mys-
terious proceedings of Scamander and Diogenes, Cicero
had already, in defending Scamander, appeared for the
other side. And the proverbial exigencies of an advo·
cate's position are still further illustrated by the passage
in the speech before us, in which he warns his readers
against looking on judicial orations as unbiassed and
impartial records of fact: ἓ 139. We ought to read the

TEx'r AND MANUSCRIPTS.

The study of the sources of the text of the pro Cluentio
reveals problems of great difficulty. With the exception
of a fragmentary palimpsest (P), there is really no manu-
script of first-class authority : those 011 which recent
editors have mainly relied (s and ⁷1¹) are not considered of
any account for the text of the other speeches which they
contain, and the version of the pro Cluentio which they
present derives support more from inference and analogy
than from the intrinsic authority of the codices them—
selves. It was Classen who first remodelled the text on
the basis of these two manuscripts. Till his edition
appeared, in 1831, editors had been content to follow the
vulgate pretty much in the form in which it exists in the
numerous Mss. of Cicero that are scattered among the
libraries of Europe. These are mostly Italian Mss. of the
fifteenth and even the sixteenth century, belonging to the
class of which Baiter has tersely said “interpolatis codiczbus
Italici-s nulla fides haberi potest.'' Many of them, while
based throughout on the vulgar tradition, have been cor-
rected from German sources ; and Olassen’s achievement
