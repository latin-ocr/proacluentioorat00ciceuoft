xxxvi PRO A. CLUENTIO.

interpreted to mean that the crimina alone constituted
the formal indictment ; it is rather a forewarning of the
position which Cicero afterwards intended to take up
(ἓὲ 143-160 : cp. especially ἕ 148, iubet lex ea qua Zeye haee
quaestio constituta est ..‚ quaerere de veneno). He cannot
deny the fact of the bribery scandal (ξ 4); if the prose-
cution had not endeavoured to fasten it directly on
Cluentius, their case would have been a very thin one
indeed (ξ 160). He therefore proceeds at once to meet
the multorum annorum accusatio (ἓ 8), and states ex-
plicitly, at a subsequent stage, his satisfaction that the
bribery scandal kas at last been made a definite issue:
ante hoe tempus omnino ista res suo nomine in iudicium
nunquam est vocata...ut hodierno die primum eausa illa
defensa sit (ξ 88).”

The only tenable alternative to the argument advanced
above would seem to be the view of Zumpt (Ro’m.
Oriminalreelzt, ii. 2), that bribery was really the main
charge against Cluentius, but that it was brought under
a clause of the Lex Cornelia which was applicable to
all persons without distinction who should be the ‘ cause
of death' to others. Zumpt relies mainly on the
language used by Paulus (Sena. ree. V. 23, 1 and ]O) in
summarizing the provisions of the Lex Cornelia, of which
he says, “poenam deportationis infligit ei qui hominem
occiderit eiusve rei causa furtive faciendi cum telo fuerit
et qui venenum hominis necandi causa habuerit vendi-
derit paraverit falsumve testimonium dixerit, quo quis
periret, mortisve eausam praestiterit.” The words in
italics may seem too indefinite, and too destitute of
support from other sources, to build such a theory on ε
if they had actually formed a part of Sulla's statute,
we may be certain that Accius would not have failed
to found on them in his speech for the prosecution‚ in
which case all Cicero’s sophistries would have been
