assedi before Gracchus effected the transfer of the iadicia

rom the senate to the equites.

mediately below: Dr. Reid points out that those words are
subtly introduced (though only the equites are really in
question) in order to pave the way for ἓξ 155, 156, where it
is alleged that the argument of Accius threatens the whole
community. See Introd. p. xxxiv.

‘opposite side of olitics,' §77, homo maxime popularis, ‘a
thorough-going ra icaL' Tamen, in what follows, = ‘for all
that,’ i.e. in spite of his political antipathies.

cum quaestionem constitueret. Sulla established
a quaestio on the basis of the law which he had revived:
it does not appear whether this was an entirely new depar-
ture, or whether such a quaestio had already existed in some
form, even under the legislation of Gaius Gracchus.

Quod, pronoun: otherwise we should have had Quod si

‘his well-known detestation of the equestrian order would
have made him only too glad,' etc.

in veteres ludices, ‘ on the jurors of the old reqima' i.e.
the knights, who had enjoyed a monopoly of the jury-courts
since the legislation of O. Gracchus. Cicero says that if
Sulla could have made the law retrospective, he would gladly
have done so: in this case it would have applied to the
knights, who were now excluded from the privilege of
serving as jurors. But he saw that only those were amenable
to its penalties who actually discharged the functions of
jurors under the new conditions, i.e. the members of the
senatorial order. In other ways, however, Sulla wreaked
his vengeance on the equites, who had resisted his measures;

and Appian tells us that 1600 of them perished by his first
proscription.

equestrian order in liability to the statute in question. The
analogy of Shakespeare’s “You stand within his danger ’³ is
more apparent than real: see on periculum, ἓ 18.
