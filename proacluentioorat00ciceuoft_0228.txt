ς ¹79. hoc praesertim in loco, ‘speaking especially in this
placsse': cp. §5, in hoc loco falsa invidia imbecilla ease debet.
gffidgnqteg'enggpne, cp. ἓ 80 below: temporie iniquita-3 atque

causam ageret, of the extra-judicial 'activity of
Quinctius, who had acted as counsel for Oppianicus: cp.
haec tum ayenle Quinctio, ἓ 108

summa potestate praeditus, Quinctius was a tribune
of the people, and even in the days of which Cicero is
speaking (Β. o. 74), while Sulla's legislation was still in force,
the tribunes had great authority at Rome. The restrictione
which Sulla had sought to impose on the tribunate, especially
in regard to initiating legislation, were removed in Β. o. 70.

invidiam infamiamque. So invidiam atque offensionem,
§ 69. For conflatam, cp. quid invidia conflarit, ἓ 9, and see on

ἓ 18.

recentem of the still raging ‘ furnace of popular dis-
pleasure.' For the collocation recentem tum, cp. tum recenti

ξ 32. The difference between the perfect and the present
infinitive may be represented in English by ‘ I remember
that he was castp etc. for the former, and ‘I remember his
being cast ’ etc. for the latter.

iam praetorem constitutum, ‘to whom general opinion
pointed as a coming praetor.’—I have ventured to insert in
the text opinionibus omnium for opinionibus hominum. The
reading below, clamore hominum, seems needed to balance
disceptatione dicendi, and the recurrence in close contiguity
of hominem aedilicium—opinionibus omnium—and clamore
hominum is not unlikely to have occasioned a difficulty with
a copyist. ΟΡ. ἓ 157.

disceptatione dicendi. ΟΡ. Le9. A9r. ii. ξ 57, nulla
disceptatione, nullo consilio .· Plane. ξ 87, non disceptando
decertandum armis fuit dimicandum. Cp. on ἓ 90.

de foro atque adeo de civitate, ‘from the legal pro-
fession, ay, and from public life itself.' Atque adeo occurs
again, ἓ 172. ΟΡ. Verr. ii. 3, adducitur atque adeo attrahitur:
