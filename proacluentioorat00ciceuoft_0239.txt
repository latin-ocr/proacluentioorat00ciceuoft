coquatus, ‘a relative by blood,' and adfinis, ‘ a connection by
marriage.’ Necessarius is used here in the general sense
which it bears in 55 43, 87: sometimes however it implies
relationship. The ablatives are all descriptive.

quaesita. Cp. quaeretur, 5 70.

prudens. Ι doubt if there is sufficient reason for alter-ing
the reading of all the Mss. here to pudens (‘ unassuming ')
on the ground that the latter epithet gives a better antithesis
to criminosus (‘ scurrilous ⁹) and seems generally more appro-
priate, especially alongside of modestus. The two words were
constantly confounded, however, by copyists. Cf. 5 144.

pacatum. Mr. Faussett supports placatum, the reading
of S'r, by reference to Post Rea. ad Q. 5 2, si mihi tranquilla
et placata omnia fuissent: cp. 138 below populum Romanam
saa sponte esse placatum. But it is equally apposite to cite

P. Popilius Laenas (consul in Rc. 132) prosecuted with
great severity those who had aided Tiberius Gracchus, and
was compelled by Gaius Gracchus, when tribune in B.c. 123,
to go into exile. After Gracchus's death he was recalled
(Brutus 5 128). It is noticeable that the Mss. give the name
wrongly: L. Popilius s'r, Ο. Popilius ω. The correct name
is found in Brutus l.c., and also in Quint. V. 10, 108. I am
inclined to think that the source of the confusion in such
cases is that in the archetype the letter P was made to do
double duty: e. g. Popilius for P. Popilius: cp. 523, Aurius
for A. Aurius x also 5 24.
