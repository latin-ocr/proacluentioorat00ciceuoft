threatened calumniae iudicium: for calumnia was a iu·
dicium publicum.

vobis isdem fortasse patronis: ‘in which perhaps you
will again act as his counsel.' Vobis, referring to Accius and
his friends, seems preferable to nobis: Cicero himself had
probably already been retained by Cluentius for the defence.

calumniam non effugiet: ‘ shall not escape the con·
sequences of fraudulent accusation 't cp. calumniam serre,
ad Fam. viii. 8. 1, to be convicted of bringing a vexatious
prosecution. &alumnia is here used for calumniae iudicium,
with consequent penalties in case of conviction, one of which
penalties (under a Lex Remmia) was probably to have the
letter K (the initial of Kalumm'a) branded on the forehead ( pro
Rosc. Am. §57). It was open to a defendant, on acquittal‚
to bring the calumniae iudicium, by which he could recover
substantial damages. See Dici. Ant. s. v. Oalumuia.

hominem multorum hospitem. ‘person greatly given to
hospitality.’ The alternative reading hominem multorum
hospitum (genitive of quality) would give the same sensez but
the statement that Ambivius is the “ entertainer of many‚''
seems appropriate as more nearly anticipating the words εἰ
invitaverit id quod solet, below.

coponem de via Latina: ‘an inn-keeper on the Latin
way.’ De is used of the source or abode from which: cp.
Or. ξ 47, non enim declamatorem aliquem de ludo aut rabulam
de foro quaerimus. Oopo (caupo) contains the same root as
κάπηλος.

etiam nunc: a frequent collocation in Cicero, ας. Sex.
Rosc. §773 Sesc. 594.

si invitaverit: ‘ if he invites us, after his usual fashion‚
we shall give him so warm a reception that he will regret
having gone out of his beat) For this colloquial use of
accipere, cp. Plaut. Aul. 4. 4. 3, eqo te miseris iam accipiam
modis. There is a double emendo-e throughout, the words
being chosen with special reference to the trade of an inn-
keeper. ‘If this entertaining person gives us an opening
(i.e. really brings his action. and asks us to ‘come on') we
shall give so good an account of him (sic hominem accipiemus,
i.e. in defending the action), that he will regret having left
his ordinary line of business? Accipiemus does not neces-
sarily point to a ‘turnin ng of the tables' between host
and guest, though it woul be possible to render, ‘If in
