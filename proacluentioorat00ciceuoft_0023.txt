INTRODUC‘TION. xix

the same as that of emitur· in the sentence immediately
preceding. Cicero’s attempt to whitewash Scamander
at the previous trial had altogether failed. Only one
juror, the notorious Staienus, could be got to accept
the suggestion that it was a harmless drug that Diogenes
brought with him (as from his reputed master, the
doctor Cleophantus, though he had now passed by
purchase into the hands of Cluentius, §47); and that he
had been suborned to bring a poison instead, in order that
his new master might be in a position to raise a false
charge against Scamander, and indirectly against
Oppianicus. If Scamander was really innocent, and if
the poison was being “planted on'' him (to use a
colloquial term) by Diogenes, why should he have
compromised himself, the prosecutor asked, by repairing
to a secret rendezvous, and by bringing a sum of money
in a sealed packet ’.ἰ (ἕ 53).

Combining the account of the line of defcnce which
Cicero represents himself as having adopted at the trial
of Scamander (ξ 52) with the argument he advances at
the present trial, we cannot help noting that the whole
story turns on the testimony of Diogenes, and that there
is some prima facie ground for the. suggestion that-the
plot may have been got up by Cluentius himself.
Diogenes was, after all, only a slave, and could easily
have been influenced by his new master to say just what
he was wanted to say. The untrustworthiness of the
testimony of a slave is quite a common-place in Cicero's
speeches, and the impropriety of taking evidence against
an accused person from the slave of his accuser is specially
illustrated in the pro Milone (ἐξ 59, 60).1 The narrative
of the text does not sufficiently disclose the real object
