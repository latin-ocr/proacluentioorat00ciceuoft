Philippic, especially the beginning of ch. vi. The language of
the text, which expresses the Epicurean view embodied in the
Third Book of Lucretius (see especially iii. 830), resembles
that which Sallust put into the mouth of Julius Caesar, Cat.

in construing which the words in venas atque in omnes partes
corporis permanare must be taken with each term of the
sentence Faciliusne potuit...latius potuit ...celerius potuit. But
this is not so satisfactory as if each clause had stood by itself‚
