NOTES. 261

Fausset, is intelligible enough, and might be adopted if it did
not involve, so to speak, a new point of departure. But the
Ms alios is undoubtedly right: other gods—different, that is to
say, from the di immortales of the preceding sentence. It

might even stand alone, but the occurrence of quos in 'r ·

(quos alios deos)—if it be not simply a dittography on quos
ltuic Cluentio—seems to point to the emendation of Lambinus
quosdam, for which it may have stood in some contracted
form such as quasa deos. I have accordingly, with Classen
and Ramsay, received quosdam into the text.1 For this use of
quidam, to soften a figurative expression, cp. ἓ 96, ruina
quaedam atque tempestas. Dr. Reid's suggestion quasi alteros
deos would be acceptable enough if it were not for the
occurrence of alios in the MSS.: cp. pro Milone, ἓ 102,
parentem alterum: Verr. iv, 17, altera patria.

, hujus importunitatem matris: ‘ this monster oi a mother.'
See on ἓ 12: and cp. ἓ 177.

misericordiae concesserunt, i. e. have pardoned the
offences of children out of compassion for their parents.
Fausset compares Prov. (lons. §44, me dolorem et inimicitias
meas· rei publicae concessisse, ‘ have waived in consideration of
the public interest.'

condonetis, ‘sacrifice': ἐξ 109, 201.

ex altera parte ε cp. ex contraria parte, ἓ 7.

111 tanto eius periculo, ‘in his great hour of need.'
sublevarent: so condemnaretur, ἕ 148, adferret, ξ 168.

idque in praesentia [communi Italiae pace] in domesticis
copiis esse totum: ‘ and that at this moment it is wholly in
the keeping of the forces of the hearth and home.' This
reading has the merit of adhering to the unanimous tradition
of the MSS„ except that I have ventured to reject communi
Italiae pace as a gloss. The domesticae copiae are obviously,
as Ramsay points out, the women and children, who are
again referred to, by a hyperbole, in the next sentence, Quos
tamen ipsos, etc„ though not to the exclusion of those
Larinates who had not been able to make the journey to
Rome (cp. above, omnes Larinates qui valuerunt venisse Romam).
—Madvig's reading, generally adopted by edd„ is idque in
praesentia communi J taliae pace non domesticis copiis esse tutum:
‘and that at this moment it is guarded‚ not by its home forces, but
by the general peace which prevails in Italy.' This seems,

1 Since the above was written, I have noted that this reading occurs in
one of the British Museum mss. Arund. 236. This codex also omits
communi Italiae pace, as Ι propose to do, at the end of this section.
