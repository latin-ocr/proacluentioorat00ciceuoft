INTHOD UCTION. xxi

while it is important to recall the fact that Cicero does
not venture to impugn the good saith of the five jurors
who, apart from those who said Non Liquet, pronounced
for the acquittal *of the defendant. At first sight it
would certainly appear to be possible to infer that
Oppianicus was not really implicated in the alleged
attempt at poisoning, and that the jury accordingly
declined the invitation to connect him with its previous
decisions in the cases of Scamander and Fabricius. The
conviction of Oppianicus may, in fact, have been due to
some of the other counts in the indictment preferred
against him.

THE TRIAL or OPPIANICUS BEFORE J umus.
(Iudz‘cz'u'm Iunianum).

The following is the account which, in the speech
before us, Cicero gives of the circumstances of this trial.
Oppianicus felt that his case was hopeless, in view of the
judgments previously recorded against Scamander and
Fabricius. Having decided to endeavour to infiuence
the jury, he approached Staienus, who was known to
have given the solitary vote in favour of Scamander ; and,
finding Staienus a willing instrument, he placed in his
hands the sum of 640‚000 sesterces (about 565440) with
which to bribe sixteen members of the bench, whose
votes, together with his own, would secure a majority of
the whole thirty-two. Staienus made promises to certain
venal jurors, but secretly determined to keep 'all the money
to himself, calculating that the conviction of Oppianicus
would save him from all risk of being called to account
for his intromissions. So he pretends that Oppianicus
has played him false, and will not pay; and he advises
his venal colleagues that the best thing they could do
would be to follow his example and vote for a conviction.
