aerarios reliquit.. I nter quattuor et xxx tribue et 0. Claudium
aerarium fore (Livy, l. c ). Cp. in aerariis relinquere (de Off.
i. 540). Dr. Reid thinks the meaning here is to‘ ‘leave
among the aerarii a man who possessed the qualifications
that would lift him above that class but for the adverse
opinion of the censors as to his character. ’' But quid de eo
statutum esset, belom seems to point to a definite degradation.

ξ 12¹7. Nam haec quidem. Though it is temptin to read
Iam for Nam (cp. ἓξ 46 and note, 57, 67, 109), it is etter to
assume an ellipse, e.9. ‘ and they were right ε for who would
say that the censors were sufficiently careful in the case
before us?' Tr. “Why, with regard to the note in question
who would hazard the opinion that‘,'' etc. In Nam illud
quidem, ἓ 148 below, the transition is easier: cp. Verr. iii.
ἓ 107, Nam illud quidem non dices. On the other hand, Iam
illud quidem perspicuum est (de Fin. i. ξ 56), summarising an
argument.

dicant. Madvig proposed to read iudicant, which is
adopted by Miiller. But there seems to be no reason for
departing from the unanimous tradition of the MSS. 3and

having regard to Cicero’ s use of videlicet· 1n replying to3 ques-
tions, I now insert a mark of interrogation after dicant. Cp.

ἓ 148, Qui eorum? Videlicet qui supra scripti eunt: also ξ 143:
anc. §4;4 in Verr. ii. 2. 80. The subjectis certainly censores,
a fact which has an important bearing on the very difficult
passage, Aut illud adferant immediately below. Madvig
thinks that such an appeal to the censors is quite out of
place: but cp. the whole of ἕ 129, and dicunt, existimant,

ut habebantur, of the whole drift of the tribune’s har-
anguing: construe as the passive of habere contionem. For

contio, cp. ἐξ 127, 103.

in culpa ponendi. So ἓ 57, in honore atque beneficio
ponerent: pro Sest„ ξ 139, in laude positos: Verr. iii. §212
Neque eqo hoc in tua laude pono.

adfines, ‘connected with, ' ‘ implicated in ’· Plaut. Trin.
331. So pro Sulla, §70, huic adfines sceleri, Catil. iv, 6, and
elsewherep The genitive also occurs: pro Sulla, 517, huius
adfines suspicionis: de Inv. ii. ξ 129, adfinem esse alicuius
culpae eum qui accusaretur. Ter. Haut. 215, illarum adfines

rerum. No difference of meaning can be established between
the two constructions.
aut fflud adferant. Taken by itself‚ this might very

well be a challenge to the other side, especially as we have m
what precedes auctoritate censorum. ..iudicari‚ and not, for
