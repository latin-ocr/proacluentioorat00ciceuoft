Habiti merito fecit, πλε. he only discharged an obligation
to Cluentius. This construction with merito is the same as
e.‚q. meo roqatu, iussu civium, etc. A comic superlative occurs
Plaut. Asin. 737, M eritissimo eius quae volet faciemus.

infitiatum esse, ‘ that he refused to allow ’ a legacy duly
bequeathed to Florus. Inficiari is a technical term in this
connection: Juv. xiii. 60, Nunc si depositum nou, infitietur
amicus. So infitiator, de Or. i. ἓ 168, where Wilkins quotes
Isidor. Θήρ. ν. 26, inficiatio est ‘neyatio debitae rei cum α
creditore deposcitur. Op. Martial i. 103. ll, in ius, ο fallax

ei, sc. Floro: lit. ‘ that it was not sufficiently secured to
Florus.’ Cluentius thought, in fact, that Florus could not
show a sufficient title to the larger sum. The insertion of

ς 163. calumniator, a ‘ blackmailer‚' or professional prose-
cutor ε cp. συκοφάντης. The general meaning of calumnia is

cum servis Habiti furti egit, ‘ brought an action of theft
3513?th the slaves of Habitus.' Furti is genitive of the

1110 privato iudicio, ‘in the civil action,’ viz. the trial
