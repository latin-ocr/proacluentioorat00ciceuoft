258 PRO Α. CL UENTIO.

ially the reference is to the complicity of Sassia, not to the guilt
of Fabricius, and I have accordingly introduced a full stop at
Fabriciani veneni, in order to show that Quodis not limited to
venenum. We are told· in ξ 57 that the guilt of Fabricius was
sels-evident ς there is no word there of any difficulty in
crediting it on the part of Cluentius (huic incredibile). In
this passive construction of celare, the acc. of the person is
made the subject, and instead of the accusative of the thing,
de with the ablative is employed.

quod si esset: quod si quid ita coyicatum esset, ἰ. e. had
he laid his plot all by himself, without Sassia's connivance.

domum scelerum omnium adfluentem : ‘ a house that
was a very sink of iniquity‚' cp. ἓ 27. The genitive is certainly a
less usual construction with verba abundandi than the ablative.
But cp. de Or. ii. ἓ 154, referta Pytlcaqoreorum : ad Ate.
viii. 1. 3, urbem refertam locupletium: Phil. ii. ἓ 67,
domuc plena ebriorum: also Ter. Adelph. 765, omnium
rerum satur. These instances support the view that this
genitive is used when speaking of large numbers.

her bosom.’ For the position of mater, cp. Verg. Ecl. v, 23,

people in general.' See on ξ 28, Ita quod ceteri. Tr. ‘As a
general rule.. .we see, etc.. but this woman, '.etc The read-
ing videmus, which is adopted 1n the text, (for vidimus STF)
may be held to derive some support from the present m the
next sentence, ceteri deponunt, which is again contrasted
with illa pulavit. Vidimus is explained as an instance of
the sententious or gnomic perfect, used of that which has
been, or shall be. But this usage is mostly confined to poetry,
and does not seem so appropriate with video. Instances are:
Juv. X. 7, Evertere domos tota-3 optantibus ipsis di faciles:
Hor. Ο. iii. 2. 29, saepe Diespiter neylectws incesto addidit
inlegsrum.
