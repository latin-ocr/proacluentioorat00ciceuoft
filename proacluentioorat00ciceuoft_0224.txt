in a somewhat similar form, immediately below: pulchre
adseverat sese ab Oppianico destitutum. Madvig and others
have strangely suspected these latter words as not belonging to
the original text. The repetition would indeed be intolerable‚
but I am convinced, from the whole structure of the sentence,
that it is in queritur se ab Oppianico destitutum that we have
a clear case of an adscript. They are just such words as
would naturally be written in the margin to serve as a guide
to a memorable passage.

Q. θῶας 20, ex fraude, fallaciis, mendaciis constare totus videtur.

studio atque artificio quodam malitiae: ‘ by zealous
apphcation, and by making roguery, so to say, his regular
profession.’ For artificium, cp. ex intimo artificio, §582 pro

pronuntiari, sc. a praecone. When both sides had
finished their pleadings, the crier of the court announced the

together as to their verdict. For the impersonal use, cp.
reticeri, ἓ 18, and the instances cited there.

sententiis xvi. Staienus's vote was regarded as certain,
and thus there would have been a majority for acquittal. A
tie (16 votes to 16) would have resulted in ampliatio.

ut, ‘ on the supposition that,' ‘in the expectation that.’

ad cumulum, ‘ to crown all‚’ lit. ‘for a crown‚’ cumulus
being here the ‘ crown ’ or ‘ summit’ which completes the
heap, not the heap itself. Tr. , ‘ crowned as it would be with
a seventeenth from Staienus himself!

Atque etiam, a formula of continuatim, as ἓ 72 ad inita
tr., ‘ Well, but as luck would have it.' Cp. ἐξ 122, 163, 181.

involved in the investigation which they were to conduct.
